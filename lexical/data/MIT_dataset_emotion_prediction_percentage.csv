0,0,p1, Im pretty good. ok uhm so have you looked at my resume or should I alright so I guess ah I am course 6-7 here at M.I.T ah which is computational biology so its a mix of computers science and biology and actually thats where my interest lie in applying like algorithmic kinda software engineering too datasets dealing with genomics and biology. Uhm some of that activities that you do out side of school include Camp Kesem which is a summer camp that we run for completely free for kids whose parents have cancer as well as ah amphibious achievement which is ah a high school tutoring program for inner city kids in Boston  So ah my interest kinda laid both in a little bit of the health care I imagined I was going be a Doctor growing up and then it came down to the tee and Im like well I can do engineering and still apply and do the same things and help a lot more people. Ok uhm one of the things we have to do for Camp Kesem is orgin or fundraise all the money to ah to run the camp which is over $50 000.00. Ah so one of the things that I individually spearhead every year is called the Camp Kesem I say you did auction where actually my fraternity and I go out and solicit uhm donations in the form of gift cards ah to raise money for a date auction where we actually sell dates and then we use this money obviously we donate it to Camp Kesem. I spearhead the entire event and I kinda orginize everyone into committees and groups and I send the people out and make sure everything goes according to plan.  Ahh I guess the easiest team project I just I just had was last semester uhm I worked on this six double o five project which is algorithm or software architecture. and we were put in a group of 3 people and it was standard you know we signed the contract everyone is supposed to work equally but it ended up being by the end of it that someone didnt like put there fair share of work in...Ah essentially we talked to him we didnt really get it out we actually had to go to some of the T.As we got a little bit ah and that kinda like pushed him forward so I mean I guess what I am showing is like Im not affraid to go to the right method or like authority like where in cases this situation presents itself.  Uhmmm. I would say for this job ah Im a little technically underprepared. Ah Ive yet I have only taken the introductory software classes so far and as well as introductory bio classes but I think just from sheer interest and sheer effort i will be able to kinda overcome these obstacles. Ah Im very interested in the subject of computation biology and I think that I will be able to contribute a lot to this field uhm Ive had a good amount of experience and I think I will be a solid intern.,"[' Im pretty good.', 'ok uhm so have you looked at my resume or should I alright so I guess ah I am course 6-7 here at M.I.T ah which is computational biology so its a mix of computers science and biology and actually thats where my interest lie in applying like algorithmic kinda software engineering too datasets dealing with genomics and biology.', 'Uhm some of that activities that you do out side of school include Camp Kesem which is a summer camp that we run for completely free for kids whose parents have cancer as well as ah amphibious achievement which is ah a high school tutoring program for inner city kids in Boston  So ah my interest kinda laid both in a little bit of the health care I imagined I was going be a Doctor growing up and then it came down to the tee and Im like well I can do engineering and still apply and do the same things and help a lot more people.', 'Ok uhm one of the things we have to do for Camp Kesem is orgin or fundraise all the money to ah to run the camp which is over $50 000.00.', 'Ah so one of the things that I individually spearhead every year is called the Camp Kesem I say you did auction where actually my fraternity and I go out and solicit uhm donations in the form of gift cards ah to raise money for a date auction where we actually sell dates and then we use this money obviously we donate it to Camp Kesem.', 'I spearhead the entire event and I kinda orginize everyone into committees and groups and I send the people out and make sure everything goes according to plan.', 'Ahh I guess the easiest team project I just I just had was last semester uhm I worked on this six double o five project which is algorithm or software architecture.', 'and we were put in a group of 3 people and it was standard you know we signed the contract everyone is supposed to work equally but it ended up being by the end of it that someone didnt like put there fair share of work in...Ah essentially we talked to him we didnt really get it out we actually had to go to some of the T.As we got a little bit ah and that kinda like pushed him forward so I mean I guess what I am showing is like Im not affraid to go to the right method or like authority like where in cases this situation presents itself.', 'Uhmmm.', 'I would say for this job ah Im a little technically underprepared.', 'Ah Ive yet I have only taken the introductory software classes so far and as well as introductory bio classes but I think just from sheer interest and sheer effort i will be able to kinda overcome these obstacles.', 'Ah Im very interested in the subject of computation biology and I think that I will be able to contribute a lot to this field uhm Ive had a good amount of experience and I think I will be a solid intern.']","[array([0.14461343, 0.00188156, 0.01500778, 0.00210984, 0.83638746],

1,1,p10, Great how about you? Im a little  by the resurgence of the hurricane but..[laughter] Yeah we were half way here and it just turned on a switch lightening winds and everything. So yeah. Okay um Im a Junior here at MIT um Im studying aerospace engineering um my my interests are generally in food mechanics control um design um mostly aircraft but protozoan  problems in general. Um I like to um I like to play music listen to music um I run do some other team sports I like to play hockey. Um okay so uh one of the projects that Ive worked on since coming to MIT um was during my Freshman year I worked in the in the uh Artificial Intelligence group in uh Cesil [sp] which is a lab a computer science lab here at MIT. And um I was working on a project with another student actually another Freshman uh basically we were tasked with the sort of bringing this project starting this project bring it up to the level where it could be presented at conference. -hmm. Um together and we were kind of left to work out the cooperation on our own and um  there was um as the conference got closer about halfway um about halfway through the year Freshman year ah there were a bunch of issues that we had with um with um basically meeting the expectations that had been set before us in terms of what we were going to present. Um and finishing in a timely basis.-hmm. And it came down to whether we were really going to be able to and there were other basically parts other peoples work in the same group where work depended on us finishing in time so it really um really we had to make a decision weather we were just going to basically get done what we could but to the quality standard that the standard of quality that was expected of us or to um try to finish everything and to have other peoples work potentially suffer because of our [??] hadnt really been up to snuff. And um and so we kind of had a little bit of a disagreement about this but what ended up happening was um I went and talked to the professor and um sort of decided to um make them aware of what was happening because they werent really aware that we had fallen behind. And um sort of got the other student on board who had disagreed with me uh to do this uh and to let everyone else know what was going on and uh we ended up presenting a lot less than what was originally expected but um I think it was very much for the better. Okay um so another another thing that I spend a lot of my time doing is called is an organization called Design Build Fly here um its its a design competition um run by the IAA which is an aerospace professional organization. And um  and uh you can enter a team from any university or group basically anywhere in the world. Its mostly US university though.-hmm. And um these university teams basically build a plane um design it build it fly it as the competition name suggests and you compete them all at the end of the year compete against the other universities at the end of the year at one competition. Basically um last year we had uh a design challenge it was pretty unique um and um so Ill take that as our challenge um so we basically had a year to solve this um and I was head of one of the sub-groups last year the actual design sub-group and um I mean we approached in a methodical way just like I think thats the best way to solve most problems. Um got input from every team member um and um basically um looked at looked at all our possibilities um  and um we ran the numbers. Ultimately like I think thats the best way to solve most problems. We ended up with um a design that got the best overall score...-hmm. ...on the basis of just basically incorporating um every team members input.-hmm. Tell me about one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome it. Okay um so one of my I think definitely since coming here Ive noticed that one of my biggest weaknesses is written communication. Um I really was not intimidated by the thought of it in high school but I um definitely since coming here I find that perhaps um at the expense of technical skills my written communication skills have atrophied maybe is the right word. And um so I definitely I think Im um pretty aware of this and um and um.. I would definitely like to improve it and um...-hmm. ...so what Im going to do is try to force myself whenever Im writing papers or taking reports for whether it be for research or for classes just to go through the proper revision cycle force myself to make sure that Im actually being um that Im being succinct in what Im saying have other people reading give me feedback. Okay um I um I mean I think I dont know what this position that it is... Yeah sure but if I knew that this position was I think that I would want it because um this is really what I thrive off of. I um enjoy doing it um and I would be excited to come to work every day to do it. Um which um thats like the biggest thing for me. I um I would be excited to come do it and I know I would put my you know put my all into doing a good job at it because I would be excited to come do it. And um I think that um I have a decent skill set to do this and I think that Im qualified to contribute in this area.-hmm.

2,2,p11, Uhh Im a junior at MIT uhh Im double majoring in Management and Biology er Im very interested in the world of finance uh business consulting all of those sorts of things. Um so Ive tried to take on different leadership roles that would prepare me for uh those sort of roles in the business world. Outside of school I enjoy running cross-country and track Im on the varsity team at MIT. And umm Im also very involved in Greek Life at MIT so Im on the Panhellenic Executive Board as Vice President of Programming and also hold a leadership position in my sorority. Umm so I think this past year my biggest priority has been my position as Vice President of Programming for Panhellenic and umm just in that position uhh I hold a leadership role on the exec board. We have weekly meetings Im charge of putting together our programming calendar for our entire year. So I have interface with a lot of MIT faculty and bring together the exec board as a whole and the different sororities uhh to meet and attend different events. And I think to put together all these events Im working together with different people on campus I have to show leadership and show strong communication skills. Umm so I guess this past semester actually Im associate advisor for umm freshmen and I work with my freshmen advisor as well and another associate advisor and er  the three of us were trying to come up with an event to host for the freshman and I think we all er were very uhh set on our ideas. So having to full time communicate and work on an idea that could bring all our thoughts and goals together . Um so we had to work together to formulate some sort of event that would satisfy each of our different goals and that was difficult at first ‘cause we had just met each other and it was difficult to understand where the other people were coming from. But after that and after communicating what our main goals for the event for would be we eventually figured out what we wanted to do. Uhh yeah so we had — we were trying to communicate via email at first so I think that was uhh inefficient especially since we had only met in a group once before umm so meeting in person and really trying to outline not just like  what the event was going to be what our purpose of the event was going to be and what we trying to communicate with the freshmen. I think by boiling down to what our purpose was for the event we were able to build it up from there. Umm so I think one of my weaknesses is public speaking actually and uhh I think by taking a variety of classes especially this one class that Im in that focuses on management and communication . Ive been kind of thrown into positions where I have to give impromptu speeches uhh and debate my point in different arguments and I think that the practice is helping me a lot and it allows me to become more comfortable and more confident in what Im saying which I think helps me in the long run like public speaking in general. I think Ive been able to build up my confidence and know like how to structure my speeches and interviews and impromptus better.

3,3,p12, Im good how are you? Ok so Im a Junior at MIT majoring in Mechanical Engineering. Uh my focus is in uh Robotics and Product Design. Uh Im originally from Seattle Washington. Ummm Im really interested in a combination of robotics and like psychology phased in. So artificial intelligence or that vein of thinking. Um Im also I do a little bit of theater on the side. So considering doing some sort of combination. Its a wide range of interests so Im trying to figure out a way to uh put in a lot of it into one thing but yeah. Mmhmm. Yeah ok. So um in high school I was a life guard. And thats it was a great job but it was a lot of working with other lifeguards in kind of in a a team situation. Um and a lot of the times one person would have to step up in order to be a leader with you know uh like swi- like we taught swim lessons. And I would have a partner with me and wed both be teaching the same kids. And Id have to you know tell them what to do or tell them what exactly we were going to do during that class. That sort of stuff. Ok ummm not going to use the lifeguard example again.(both laugh) Uhhhh in high school we would have to work on team projects a lot ummm I dont know in history class or that kind of a thing work working with projects. And sometimes wed have kids who wouldnt do their home- do you know their part on time or people who didnt like they what they were doing. There was one specific time where we had a conflict where one girl just decided she didnt really want to do you know any of the any of the project she wasnt really showing up to class wasnt doing any of the any of the stuff she had to so we had to talk to her and figure out what was going on and kind of resolve the conflict in that way. In what way? Like - Yeah. So I mean us as a group we met with the teacher umm and told her what was happening. And then The next the next day when the girl came to class we you know sat her down asked her why she wasnt doing the homework. Whatever that kind of stuff. But it was it was just a case of high school kids not wanting to do anything. So (laughs). Ok ummm I have a really bad habit of trying to do everything all at once and I sometimes put too much on my plate. And I recognize that you have to delegate tasks in a group or tell someone when theyve given you too much to do. So I think its kind of in terms of how Im trying to improve that is be realistic with myself on the amount of time I have or what my skills are. And if I need help ask for it or if I need someone to do part of it ask for it. And early on not the day before something has to be done tell them that its not going to happen.- why do you think we should hire you? Ummmm I think you should hire me because your company ummm is a great would be a great opportunity for me to learn and improve as an Engineer umm and I think I could just add a lot to the team in general in terms of like like my wide interests and and education background.,"[' Im good how are you?', 'Ok so Im a Junior at MIT majoring in Mechanical Engineering.', 'Uh my focus is in uh Robotics and Product Design.', 'Uh Im originally from Seattle Washington.', 'Ummm Im really interested in a combination of robotics and like psychology phased in.', 'So artificial intelligence or that vein of thinking.', 'Um Im also I do a little bit of theater on the side.', 'So considering doing some sort of combination.', 'Its a wide range of interests so Im trying to figure out a way to uh put in a lot of it into one thing but yeah.', 'Mmhmm.', 'Yeah ok.', 'So um in high school I was a life guard.', 'And thats it was a great job but it was a lot of working with other lifeguards in kind of in a a team situation.', 'Um and a lot of the times one person would have to step up in order to be a leader with you know uh like swi- like we taught swim lessons.', 'And I would have a partner with me and wed both be teaching the same kids.', 'And Id have to you know tell them what to do or tell them what exactly we were going to do during that class.', 'That sort of stuff.', 'Ok ummm not going to use the lifeguard example again.', '(both laugh) Uhhhh in high school we would have to work on team projects a lot ummm I dont know in history class or that kind of a thing work working with projects.', 'And sometimes wed have kids who wouldnt do their home- do you know their part on time or people who didnt like they what they were doing.', 'There was one specific time where we had a conflict where one girl just decided she didnt really want to do you know any of the any of the project she wasnt really showing up to class wasnt doing any of the any of the stuff she had to so we had to talk to her and figure out what was going on and kind of resolve the conflict in that way.', 'In what way?', 'Like - Yeah.', 'So I mean us as a group we met with the teacher umm and told her what was happening.', 'And then The next the next day when the girl came to class we you know sat her down asked her why she wasnt doing the homework.', 'Whatever that kind of stuff.', 'But it was it was just a case of high school kids not wanting to do anything.', 'So (laughs).', 'Ok ummm I have a really bad habit of trying to do everything all at once and I sometimes put too much on my plate.', 'And I recognize that you have to delegate tasks in a group or tell someone when theyve given you too much to do.', 'So I think its kind of in terms of how Im trying to improve that is be realistic with myself on the amount of time I have or what my skills are.', 'And if I need help ask for it or if I need someone to do part of it ask for it.', 'And early on not the day before something has to be done tell them that its not going to happen.- why do you think we should hire you?', 'Ummmm I think you should hire me because your company ummm is a great would be a great opportunity for me to learn and improve as an Engineer umm and I think I could just add a lot to the team in general in terms of like like my wide interests and and education background.']","[array([0.23260541, 0.00101473, 0.00569431, 0.00083825, 0.75984734],

4,4,p13, Good. Ok umm Im currently a junior at M.I.T. studying electrical engineering and computer science. Umm I first became interested in engineering in high school I guess when I worked in a lab at a material science lab at U.C. Berkley. Umm and since then Ive worked at a variety of different places including labs and at uh and in the industry including electrical engineering labs here and at Standford and umm Promex Industries which is a chip packaging company in the silicon valley. Umm in high school I was part of the school orchestra and I played bassoon. I was the principle bassoon there. So that means I was in charge of the bassoon section. So basically umm I ran extra I ran practices for within our section outside of uh  when the orchestra would get together and practice. I coordinated that. I also uh set up events between the woodwind sections to uh you know so people would get to know each other and you know we could practice together and things like that. Umm this past summer I worked in Spain. Umm in operations research and I was part of a research group there. Umm it was so we had uh within our team it was communicating with each other was the biggest challenge because my Spanish isnt so great and their English wasnt so great. So umm what we ended we basically communicated through like the papers through the papers we read umm we well one thing that helped was we both got like everyone they got better at speaking English I got better at understanding them. I guess they got better at understanding my Spanish also. So we were able to communicate by just you know talking really slowly repeating everything a couple times. Umm we also did a lot of technical things and so those were mostly related to technical papers and things like that. Those were written mostly in English so that was that wasnt so much of a problem for me...but...it made it because they were working in the area already and I was new to the area looking through these made it easier for me to understand what my role was what I was supposed to do. Umm things like that. umm well one thing right now is that I can get really hung up on small details and uh it becomes a problem because its it can be distracting and cause me to lose sight of like the big picture. But since coming to M.I.T. Ive been Ive been involved in a lot of classes a lot of activites and things and thats forced me to manage my time better. So now that uh like I have because I have a lot of time constraints Im forced to finish a project or assignment or whatever and I cant I cant get caught up in like little things that dont ultimately make a big a difference. So um by being forced to manage my time more Im uh overcoming this problem. Well I have the I have the quantitative and qualitative skills necessary to accomplish uh accomplish project goals and get things done. Uh I can solve problems and and can work pretty well in a team. Im also very interested in what this company does and um Id really like to work there.,"[' Good.', 'Ok umm Im currently a junior at M.I.T.', 'studying electrical engineering and computer science.', 'Umm I first became interested in engineering in high school I guess when I worked in a lab at a material science lab at U.C.', 'Berkley.', 'Umm and since then Ive worked at a variety of different places including labs and at uh and in the industry including electrical engineering labs here and at Standford and umm Promex Industries which is a chip packaging company in the silicon valley.', 'Umm in high school I was part of the school orchestra and I played bassoon.', 'I was the principle bassoon there.', 'So that means I was in charge of the bassoon section.', 'So basically umm I ran extra I ran practices for within our section outside of uh  when the orchestra would get together and practice.', 'I coordinated that.', 'I also uh set up events between the woodwind sections to uh you know so people would get to know each other and you know we could practice together and things like that.', 'Umm this past summer I worked in Spain.', 'Umm in operations research and I was part of a research group there.', 'Umm it was so we had uh within our team it was communicating with each other was the biggest challenge because my Spanish isnt so great and their English wasnt so great.', 'So umm what we ended we basically communicated through like the papers through the papers we read umm we well one thing that helped was we both got like everyone they got better at speaking English I got better at understanding them.', 'I guess they got better at understanding my Spanish also.', 'So we were able to communicate by just you know talking really slowly repeating everything a couple times.', 'Umm we also did a lot of technical things and so those were mostly related to technical papers and things like that.', 'Those were written mostly in English so that was that wasnt so much of a problem for me...but...it made it because they were working in the area already and I was new to the area looking through these made it easier for me to understand what my role was what I was supposed to do.', 'Umm things like that.', 'umm well one thing right now is that I can get really hung up on small details and uh it becomes a problem because its it can be distracting and cause me to lose sight of like the big picture.', 'But since coming to M.I.T.', 'Ive been Ive been involved in a lot of classes a lot of activites and things and thats forced me to manage my time better.', 'So now that uh like I have because I have a lot of time constraints Im forced to finish a project or assignment or whatever and I cant I cant get caught up in like little things that dont ultimately make a big a difference.', 'So um by being forced to manage my time more Im uh overcoming this problem.', 'Well I have the I have the quantitative and qualitative skills necessary to accomplish uh accomplish project goals and get things done.', 'Uh I can solve problems and and can work pretty well in a team.', 'Im also very interested in what this company does and um Id really like to work there.']","[array([2.5457432e-02, 1.0670138e-03, 1.0337941e-03, 8.8544219e-04,

5,5,p14, Good how are you? Im a student at MIT and Im a junior right now but Im probably gonna graduate this year. So uh thats kind of exciting at scary at the same time. Uh like I said Im a computer science major so some of the stuff that Im interested in is computational photography and a lot of graphic stuff. Ive got a bunch of experience with web development mainly uh front end development so thats uh I guess where a lot of my experience lies.  Um so I was a member of the Society of Women Engineers and with the Graduate Students Association of MIT and the senior class they run the fall career fair which is the only career fair in the fall and its the biggest at MIT. I was actually the publicity chair for that. So it involves you know interfacing you know with over 230 companies and dealing with not only making the guide book and making sure all of the information is readily available to students but also publicizing individual info sessions and obviously the career fair itself. SO um it definitely was a lot of responsibility and not only did I have to become a leader for the Society of Women Engineers but also fora leader for this smaller team of seven people that ran the career fair itself.  Well I...so for one of my classes we have to its a software design class where you have to work with other students. So I was assigned two teammates randomly and we had one teammate who really wasnt pulling their weight and wasnt contributing in a way that was you know fair and even and so what we ended up doing is we all thankfully were able to sit down and talk. We were able to get a hold of her and we realized it was because we were dividing the work in a way that made it really difficult for her it was not playing off her strengths. So we redistributed the work and she was able to do things that were still helpful but played more to her strengths.  Um I think one of my weaknesses is Im a perfectionist so when I do work on teams I have trouble sometimes delegating tasks because I want to micromanage and make sure everything is just the way it is. But what Ive done to overcome that is basically just sort of familiarized myself with how to um like say no to a task and just kind of I guess modualize [sic] projects more. So I think I had trouble when I was always thinking big picture and then I would want to look at every single detail i that big picture. But if I just give myself one part of the project and just you know divide it into different modules in my head then Im able to just you know perfect my one part but not so much focus on every little detail. Uh I think that my skill set is pretty unique because Im both technical and also well-spoken and Id be able to communicate really well. And I think its a unique combination to have both of those skills.,"[' Good how are you?', 'Im a student at MIT and Im a junior right now but Im probably gonna graduate this year.', 'So uh thats kind of exciting at scary at the same time.', 'Uh like I said Im a computer science major so some of the stuff that Im interested in is computational photography and a lot of graphic stuff.', 'Ive got a bunch of experience with web development mainly uh front end development so thats uh I guess where a lot of my experience lies.', 'Um so I was a member of the Society of Women Engineers and with the Graduate Students Association of MIT and the senior class they run the fall career fair which is the only career fair in the fall and its the biggest at MIT.', 'I was actually the publicity chair for that.', 'So it involves you know interfacing you know with over 230 companies and dealing with not only making the guide book and making sure all of the information is readily available to students but also publicizing individual info sessions and obviously the career fair itself.', 'SO um it definitely was a lot of responsibility and not only did I have to become a leader for the Society of Women Engineers but also fora leader for this smaller team of seven people that ran the career fair itself.', 'Well I...so for one of my classes we have to its a software design class where you have to work with other students.', 'So I was assigned two teammates randomly and we had one teammate who really wasnt pulling their weight and wasnt contributing in a way that was you know fair and even and so what we ended up doing is we all thankfully were able to sit down and talk.', 'We were able to get a hold of her and we realized it was because we were dividing the work in a way that made it really difficult for her it was not playing off her strengths.', 'So we redistributed the work and she was able to do things that were still helpful but played more to her strengths.', 'Um I think one of my weaknesses is Im a perfectionist so when I do work on teams I have trouble sometimes delegating tasks because I want to micromanage and make sure everything is just the way it is.', 'But what Ive done to overcome that is basically just sort of familiarized myself with how to um like say no to a task and just kind of I guess modualize [sic] projects more.', 'So I think I had trouble when I was always thinking big picture and then I would want to look at every single detail i that big picture.', 'But if I just give myself one part of the project and just you know divide it into different modules in my head then Im able to just you know perfect my one part but not so much focus on every little detail.', 'Uh I think that my skill set is pretty unique because Im both technical and also well-spoken and Id be able to communicate really well.', 'And I think its a unique combination to have both of those skills.']","[array([4.5620534e-01, 7.4880529e-04, 4.1863765e-04, 4.9901620e-04,

6,6,p15, Im doing fine uh thank you how about you? Um have you like you know um the storm I hope that hasnt like disturbed any power too much. Oh yeah. I mean Boston didnt get hit too bad so. -hm. Thats at least very fortunate. Um okay so Im a current junior at MIT. Im studying biological engineering. Um so its some some of the things I do on campus. Um Im really involved in um MIT Met Life. So Im Im secretary of the club and I go to the meetings um and um part of my roles like help you know organize groups where um poster sessions and information sessions. Just like spread the word of Met Life on campus um and thats um sort of helps me like explore like it has really gotten me more interested in a field of like healthcare. Um that plus like my um my studies.-hm. Um Im also involved in Chinese student club escort culture. So I do a lot of you know pudding on campus for um events like night market which I worked I helped organize just last week. So um it that sort of helps me with communication my communication skills. You know talking to the officers of other student clubs. Okay so um last um uh this past summer I worked in a research lab in Bangkok and it was the first time that I had ever been outside of you know the United States for an extended period of time. -hm. And one of my assignments was to you know sort of lead uh sort of like drive the direction of like a research project that they were doing which was to research um a generic um in hopes of releasing it to the market. Um sometime in the future. Because I had I was partnered up with some a lab partner that was less experienced than I was um I found myself in many situations having to help guide her along and getting up to speed with the project and the techniques that we needed to do our experiments. -hm. Um it was it was a little bit of a strange dynamic because she was older than me. Because she was an incoming graduate student but she did not have much research like lab experience. So I had to balance like being informative without making it seem like this like she was in some ways my superior. So that was like an um I had I had to like teach her the techniques you know coming off as like oh I know more than you do. -hm. Um but what I found was what worked for both of us was that um I would like explain it to her before we were in the lab which helped cut down a lot of the frustration that came up if like she had to ask me questions like every like between like every set. So thats um thats probably the one way I showed leadership. Okay so the a couple um IPs I worked for a start up um they were a green billing research directory online. And I worked for my fellow exterior on helping to market this the use of this directory to the clients. Um so we had to it was a little bit difficult because we had to like we had to cold call like people and getting over the initial awkwardness of what its like to talk to somebody youve never met or seen before and trying to like pitch an idea to them and be like oh theres this really great resource and youve signed up for it. But weve noticed that you like hadnt used it. -hm. Um are there things that like you feel would make it better. Um things that you would like to see that you think would make it more effective. -hm. And um we both had to sort of like teach ourselves how to talk to like the the reps that were calling and we would um strategize what worked what didnt what had people respond and what didnt and--hm. And by like documenting it all down also. So that we could leave like a record of what worked for maybe someone else was to found. So um eventually we actually got like a system. Like a way we would structure the questions and ask them that word and like list like a couple response. Okay um so something so a weakness that I found um and Im still like working to try to like overcome it is I tend to be long winded in explaining things. Um its hard for me to take something that Im thinking about and communicating it um concisely um the first time around. -hm. Because I feel like I always leave something out after I finish saying it. So I tend to go back and elaborate. -hm. And then while Im thinking about it still Ill like talk more about whats coming to mind. -hm. Um its something that Ive been working on by siding it for things like this. -hm. And by trying to take up a more prominent role in like the in like the clubs Im in and like trying to you know participate more actively in the classes. Um trying to as much as I can to go to um lab presentations for my year off and speaking--hm. In front of audiences to try to um make myself less long winded and more precise. Um I think that I can bring I dont know like something different a new perspective to the table especially coming from MIT. Um having had like a very quantitative background. -hm. Um and given that Ive had like extensive experience um in research um and my leadership activities on campus I think that I can bring both the technical skills and um a way to effectively hopefully communicate to um communicate my ideas and bring like a different sort of perspective to your company. And Im hardworking um and I always wanna make sure I will do a good job and detail oriented and um I just love working with other people on like projects that excite me.

7,7,p16, Very good how are you? Yea um so I am junior here at MIT ummm studying economics as well as urban planning and within those departments I am really trying to focus on international development. Ummm and because I am interested in either after school going in to either like public health or umm public policy type areas. But both focusing on international development. Ummm yea thats a little bit. Im from right outside of Philadelphia ummm and I am the uh second youngest of 3.  Uh sure ummm so currently I am actually the co president of an organization here on campus called club med (sp?). And we actually started last year but last year it was founded by a different person ummm although I was part of the like founding board I guess you would say. Ummm and I guess last year basically what happened was the person who founded it did it for her resume and she wasnt really invested in it. Umm and so basically last year was pretty much a flop we did we didnt accomplish much last year. So this year has been trying to start over ummm as well as trying to take what kind of we felt what was wrong last year and really try to fix those pieces. But also what I really realized from the whole experience is that leadership also needs to recognizes that you are only a leader for a certain amount of time and you really need to be able to kind of set up a situation in which you can set up so someone can transition into your spot. I mean especially in a like college setting you are going to be the president for a year or maybe two years ummm and I think what we really learned I think a lot of the struggle we learned from last year is to set up that sort of structure. Also last year there was some tension within the group just because we were like what are we doing like why arent we doing anything there wasnt a lot of transparency so really trying to emphasize that this year. And we were so I keep saying we because co-presidents its my friend Cheri and I but we are co-presidents we have been able to expand the club. Last year we had about 14 members ummm maybe like 10 or less that were truly committed so now we are at 30 members. Which is a really really exciting thing. Yea. umm that is a good question umm I think so freshman year ummm I participated in a program here called terescope (sp?). And its a program that basically gives freshman a problem to solve. Ummm kind of like a world problem. And so you are just kind of left on your own to solve it. Umm and our problem was solving world hunger. So it is really like a problem that no one has actually solved. Ummm and what I really learned from that was a lot about group dynamics I think because it was all freshman led you had like all these freshman coming from a bunch of schools where they were the top they were the ones used to leading everything. I think one of the main problems we had was maybe not necessarily like figuring out the problem but like figuring out who - how to best organize ourselves and how to best kind of - ummm when people should step up and be leaders ummm so what I guess learned from that a lot was trying to not necessary like pinpoint one leader but more like collaborative working together because what like seemed happened when one person stepped up they necc - they necessary wouldnt be doing a lot just kind of be like trying to tell people what to do. And that wasnt effective at all. Instead of just like trying to brainstorm together problem solve together. Like maybe have someone be one person be more like a facilitator and kind of leading the discussion. Instead of telling people what to do. Being like oh this is what you said and do you want to follow up on that.” Or like how can we best really tackle that issue. I think what I learned form that what I learned from that in order to be a leader within a group you need to be asking questions instead of telling people what to do. Giving people more responsibility and and almost have someone be more like. And giving people more responsibility. Umm and like make them feel like they are taking ownership versus your putting ownership on them. I think that is what the purpose of the class actually is to teach you how to work in groups throughout MIT you work in groups pete (sp?) says so I think I actually learned a lot from that class just kind of observing how everything was going on. Ummm hmmm so lets think so that is a good question. I think sometimes I have trouble working on a project when like for example when I have too much time right. So umm for example this summer I was working in DC ummm and I felt like when I wasnt given an exact dead line I didnt necessarily like push myself to work to get it done because it wasnt -- I didnt have a dead line like I wasnt sure when I needed it to get done so I was like oh that fine okay I can do it later. So I think one of my weaknesses I think it is pushing things off unless there is a deadline. So I really have been trying setting internal deadlines for myself. And trying to stick to those deadlines and I think it is really hard I think it is really hard when you have a lot of things to do to figure out how to prioritize and actually come through with the deadlines. And I think that is really important skill throughout life. So for example this week I have a lot of things due at the end of the week. So trying to get at least a certain amount done by Tuesday and kind of like evaluating my progress throughout the week is something I have been trying to work on more. - Why do you think we should hire you? Well we will pretend this is the (inaudible) institute. I am really interested in studying the intersection on nutrition and health ummm especially in the kind of evaluating project area. So recently I actually switched to economics umm I was originally studying biology but I felt that I could - that there is more to be done in economics in terms of helping people and I really would be excited to learn more about how food security and nutrition intersect. And I would be very committed and willing to work as much as you needed me to. ,"[' Very good how are you?', 'Yea um so I am junior here at MIT ummm studying economics as well as urban planning and within those departments I am really trying to focus on international development.', 'Ummm and because I am interested in either after school going in to either like public health or umm public policy type areas.', 'But both focusing on international development.', 'Ummm yea thats a little bit.', 'Im from right outside of Philadelphia ummm and I am the uh second youngest of 3.', 'Uh sure ummm so currently I am actually the co president of an organization here on campus called club med (sp?).', 'And we actually started last year but last year it was founded by a different person ummm although I was part of the like founding board I guess you would say.', 'Ummm and I guess last year basically what happened was the person who founded it did it for her resume and she wasnt really invested in it.', 'Umm and so basically last year was pretty much a flop we did we didnt accomplish much last year.', 'So this year has been trying to start over ummm as well as trying to take what kind of we felt what was wrong last year and really try to fix those pieces.', 'But also what I really realized from the whole experience is that leadership also needs to recognizes that you are only a leader for a certain amount of time and you really need to be able to kind of set up a situation in which you can set up so someone can transition into your spot.', 'I mean especially in a like college setting you are going to be the president for a year or maybe two years ummm and I think what we really learned I think a lot of the struggle we learned from last year is to set up that sort of structure.', 'Also last year there was some tension within the group just because we were like what are we doing like why arent we doing anything there wasnt a lot of transparency so really trying to emphasize that this year.', 'And we were so I keep saying we because co-presidents its my friend Cheri and I but we are co-presidents we have been able to expand the club.', 'Last year we had about 14 members ummm maybe like 10 or less that were truly committed so now we are at 30 members.', 'Which is a really really exciting thing.', 'Yea.', 'umm that is a good question umm I think so freshman year ummm I participated in a program here called terescope (sp?).', 'And its a program that basically gives freshman a problem to solve.', 'Ummm kind of like a world problem.', 'And so you are just kind of left on your own to solve it.', 'Umm and our problem was solving world hunger.', 'So it is really like a problem that no one has actually solved.', 'Ummm and what I really learned from that was a lot about group dynamics I think because it was all freshman led you had like all these freshman coming from a bunch of schools where they were the top they were the ones used to leading everything.', 'I think one of the main problems we had was maybe not necessarily like figuring out the problem but like figuring out who -

Im a six three um and Im here hoping to you know get in touch and um see if theres any opportunity for me over at Google.[inaudible] So tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership. Um see... Hm so last semester um I took a class in software constructions. So its six double-o five here. And um throughout the semester we had you know many individual projects. But also two group projects. And um something Ive noticed very much here at MIT is that people dont like to take initiative and so um you know my- we were doing out first group project and um you know my- my partners were pretty cool. But no one seemed to want to arrange a time to meet up and actually get work done. So I jumped in and you know shot- shot out a few emails. And made it work. [laugh] How about that? Um lets talk about that second group project in this class. Unfortunately my um my group members in this uh for this project were not quite as awesome as the one before. Um and uh for some reason um there were two guys and uh they- they were overriding my code in the repository. So um theyve completely disregarded any work Ive done even after Id emailed them and told them hey you know there are tools to help resolve conflicts in code--hm -if were both working on the same thing. And so eventually I had to go to the TA and to the professor went spoke to Ann Hunter. And they helped me resolve the situation. So you know sometimes you try your best in the situation and you really-- some things are out of your control. But um usually people you can go to. Thanks. Um see... I- lets see I- for the longest time even when I was small Ive always been pretty quiet. So um and back in elementary school even. Uh on my progress reports they would- they would just say Stephie is- is this sweet girl [laughs] and then you know Id get a mediocre grade for participation stuff like that. And so thats been an on going struggle for me um throughout my life. But um people really arent as scary as as sometimes I think they- they seem to be so. Its been going well. Um see uh. Well Ive- Ive taken classes with um with like speaking components and presentations. Um so its its a way to get in- my feet into the water. But um its been a good experience so. Hmm I think that I have a lot to offer. Um my skill set is pretty good? Um you know Ive- Ive picked up a lot of skills here at MIT and also on my own um through research here at MIT.-hm.

9,9,p20, Good. How are you? Um so Im a junior at MIT. Im majoring in environmental engineering. Um and so Im taking classes this semester in hydrology environmental transport. Um Ive done internships previously with environmental restoration companies. And I also participated in research last summer. Um Id like to go to Grad school after I graduate in Environmental Enginneering again. Um so this semester I became President of the Womens Independent Living Group. Um after being House Manager last semester. So Ive worked through a lot of problems within the house in trying to kind of get the right atmosphere in the house. Um So as house manager um I organized work week at the beginning of this year. So its a time when - theres about 30 members in the house and everybody gets together and um works on the house paints rooms like fixes it up before the school year starts. So I organized that assigned jobs to people and facilitated that. Um so Im also on the rowing team. And Im not sure if this is exactly what youre looking for but I guess I was in the second boat last year and we were having a lot of problems throughout the season kind of like we would go to a race and we would be okay but we werent performing up to our standards. And so it was a big struggle for me to try and figure out how to kind of help turn the attitude around in the boat. Um and we were finally able to pull it off in our very last race and we won the semi-finals at Patriot League. So I think its the right mix of like knowing when to speak up say something and knowing what to say. Um kind of by speaking up and letting people know not like putting people down but letting people know that there was way more potential to be had. Um one of my weaknesses I tend to be I guess a little more withdrawn sometimes. Um and thats something Ive been working on like Ive taken leadership in my house and as the rowing team um but I think something good about that is I tend to be a very good listener. And then Im starting to learn when to speak up and become more of a like up-front role. Um I think Im like extremely responsible. Um I have a lot of experience. And this is something that I think will help further my career goals and something Im really excited about learning about.

10,10,p21, Um pretty good. Um  yeah. So um my name is Dina Wong. Im a student at MIT. Im in my third year. Im majoring in course six seven which is biological engin-um biologic-um Computational Biology. Um Its pretty new so it only like existed my freshman year. So yeah so Ive been taking a lot of computer science and technology classes. Um in my free time I like to um write for the Tech and a be edit um articles at the um the student newspaper for the student newspaper. Um I also like to bake and like um like exercising and running stuff like that. So currently Im looking for an internship for the summer. Um I actually um Im exploring like the industry side of um like computer science ummm and I think that if I find a position or if I find like the industry side like really suits me that I would want to go for like um being hired by a company after I graduate. Ok. Soo this I guess this happens quite a bit during a my stint as um campus life editor of the Tech. So a what happens is um like um for my section I have to a make sure that the publication is like going out on time. So um one time I demonstrated leadership was in getting a um column for for the campus life section. So there was a um the precedent of the Pan-Hellenic society um want to have like a column in the Tech for Greek life. And so um I negotiated with her to like um sort to arrange how the column would work because like um I guess we both had the same like um intent of how we should like publish articles but her ideas were slightly different from mine in that she if your original idea was that she wanted to I could it was kind of like advertisement in the Tech and um people like like the Tech is a newspaper you dont like necessarily want articles to be like advertising sororities so we made a deal with her to like um write articles that would be more about the personal side and not like um to avertisey. Hmm Ah...Um I guess again probably using um let me see..ok so I guess again on for the Tech cause its like my major leadership my pretty main extracurricular. Um I guess um what happened was um shit um I really dont know how to answer these type of questions sorry. Um... Um...Ok I guess Ill go back to high school then. So in high school I was on the cross country team and um so what happened was we a like were were competing right so we um so we had to like um train in groups so on so on team sports and what happened was kind of that the um so theres a girls team and a boys team and like um the boys team a was i guess people the boys were like motivated and things like that and like they would um and the girls team was like less motivated and wha and so since they were less motivated they would do stuff like if the coach asked you to like run around this block than they would like sort of cut take short cuts and stuff like that. Um I guess what happened was my um there was another student on the team who was also who was also like really motivated and I wanted to improve running so I think initially I guess we sort of tried asking people like Hey um could you not do that? but eventually what happened was I guess we me and the other more motivated girl trained with the boys team because that was really the only way like I mean theres theres motivating people but in the sense like they have to want to do it themselves so I guess thats what happened. OK Um I would let me think. One of my I guess one weakness I have is um well MIT is full of smart people right. Um if everybody is like always doing like these amazing products and projects and I mean like coding since they were like nine years old and stuff so because of the like abundance of geniuses I sometimes I feel like Im not as at their level. So um I guess what I try what I try to do is like I I was feeling badly but then I realized. Well first of all I guess everybody has to start somewhere. Ive been like training my own skills like reach up to the to learn more in depth and eventually Ill get that good just takes like practice and Ive also been like just sort of telling myself that its to like just apply to things and like dont and I guess sort of fake it till you make it right. So make like um project the image of like confidence and then it will probably come. Well um so Ive been learning a lot about um computer science since I was here. Ive um I am a pretty reliable person so like for example during the Tech I always like am reliably like editing everything getting thing in time on deadline. Though if you gave me an assignment then I would reliably like a work on it and um and I and not procrastinate or anything like that. Um Im pretty good at learning as demonstrated by my ability to succeed at MIT and um I also um I would a really enjoy working and contributing to the Google community as a person and a I hope that a I would be able to produce um good products.,"[' Um pretty good.', 'Um  yeah.', 'So um my name is Dina Wong.', 'Im a student at MIT.', 'Im in my third year.', 'Im majoring in course six seven which is biological engin-um biologic-um Computational Biology.', 'Um Its pretty new so it only like existed my freshman year.', 'So yeah so Ive been taking a lot of computer science and technology classes.', 'Um in my free time I like to um write for the Tech and a be edit um articles at the um the student newspaper for the student newspaper.', 'Um I also like to bake and like um like exercising and running stuff like that.', 'So currently Im looking for an internship for the summer.', 'Um I actually um Im exploring like the industry side of um like computer science ummm and I think that if I find a position or if I find like the industry side like really suits me that I would want to go for like um being hired by a company after I graduate.', 'Ok.

11,11,p22, Im good. How are you? OK. Um Im a junior in aerospace engineering um Im originally from Kansas City um and I was born on the East Coast. Im currently deciding whether or not I want to go into aerospace industry or go into consulting or another aviation-related field. Im minoring in management. [pause] So can you tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership? Uh so right now Im actually quite involved with the Global Poverty Initiative here at MIT and Im currently the director of ACTION under GPI Global Poverty Initiative so Im currently in charge of the projects we are involved with abroad so that includes projects in Mexico service projects in Central Mexico...-hmm. ...as well as a project with a domestic..an NGO in India that works with domestic workers in setting up domestic workers with local employers and training women and working with employer-employee relationships. Um most of my work has been on the Mexico project and I led a team -- I actually have traveled down three times -- and we have a greenhouse initiative that is our main goal right now and I oversaw a team of four people on two separate trips where we built fourteen greenhouses as well as conducted classes at the secondary school as well as classes for adults in both computers and English.Uh and we worked with NGOs on the ground um and theyve actually managed to continue our projects since weve been gone uh as well as working with the Peace Corps and uh theyve actually recently decided to send a full-time Peace Corps volunteer to the rural community where we were working so... ...that was really validating. Um well most of the challenges that Ive faced with a team have been with my projects in Mexico. Um so probably the largest challenge that we had when we got there was working across cultures and identifying with community members because when we went there we had originally thought -- we had brainstormed project ideas like solar ovens and greenhouses and bio-digesters which are used to make fertilizer from natural waste -- and when we got there we talked to lots of community members. First of all they can be rather skeptical of outsides coming in so we first had to earn their trust and we had to establish that we werent going to um just come in and give them something and leave. This wasnt going to be a hand-out. So it was interesting being the leader within my group and trying to help those who had not had the same experiences with other cultures and working with people across borders so helping those people adjust as well as working that relationship between you know rural Mexicans who have limited experience with outsiders and are used to either government hand-outs or people coming in and doing one thing and leaving and not following up. So thats was a challenge but in the end we ended up using community feedback to determine which project we wanted to do. So they were most interested in greenhouses as well as some [?] small business so we ended up catering to both of those project ideas. The way that we decided to work around the not wanting to seem like we were giving a hand-out we actually had all the families build their own greenhouses with our help. So we distributed all the materials and then had them pay small deposits so they would have some small investment into the project. Obviously they couldnt afford to pay for the whole thing. Um then we worked with each individual family and they built it and made it their own and so they had a bigger incentive to take care of it. Yeah. Sometimes I can be disorganized. I mean I think everyone struggles with that a little bit but the way I try to deal with that...recently Ive taken to becoming a list person. [laughs] In order for me to ensure that I get things done -- I always get things done but you know when you leave things for the last minute sometimes the quality of your work is not always the best. So to deal with this Ive tried to break down all the problems and break down my tasks into small steps make lists and then set separate deadlines for each individual thing knowing that if I have things that come up and everything is all due at the same time everything needs to be done at once I can handle that. And also Ive learned that its important to delegate your tasks especially with GPI. Being director of ACTION a lot of responsibility falls on me and it can be very easy to be like Oh yeah I need to take care of this and talk to these people but thats why I have a team. There are 20 people on GPI ACTION so in order to delegate those tasks it makes my life easier and keeps those other people involved. : Why do you think we should hire you? I think I have a diverse skill set and I have very diverse background working with other cultures not only in Mexico but Ive had experiences in Europe and in China. Im bi-racial myself and I think I have a very unique background and especially as an engineer whos interested in going into consulting and I have work experience at Space-X and NASA and um other companies. I think I offer very unique perspective into what your company culture would be. And I think thats very important in not having everyone have the same background and everyone in your community...you need different perspectives and I think I would definitely help fill that. ,"[' Im good.', 'How are you?', 'OK.

12,12,p24, Im doing very well. How are you? Im currently a junior at MIT. Im studying biology. Ummm I am interested in pursuing some sort of a future in medicine but I dont know if necessarily like the medschool route or more the research side but you know having to do with patient care and drugs and things like that. So within the broader field but Im not sure specifically what path yet. Umm okay. So umm the summer after my sophomore year of high school I actually went on a leadership trip. Um so it was through uh my summer camp and some other camps are a part of the same foundation and we actually went on a trip to Israel for the summer. And it was the first time Id ever been which was very exciting um. And it was a very cool experience cause not only were they teaching a lot of leadership skills but also a lot of you know the daily activities we did like going for really long hikes and things just kind of brought out that innate like someone has to make sure everyone brought enough water. And you know make sure the groups staying together and things like that um. So that was definitely something that I think impacted me a lot. And I think you know in other leadership roles you know even in a small group project or something. A lot of the time I find myself reflecting back to that trip and kind of saying Okay we were in a tough spot like that before. How did we kinda rally the group back together?. Something like that. Umm sure. So a time when I was working on a team. So I think um this situation arises a lot of times in lab. So I was um this past summer I was back in Israel and working in a lab at the Hebrew University. Um and it was a pretty small lab. I was working um for one of the post-ocs and then there are about four other people in the lab. And so things like that kind of came up all the time where it would be a matter of Okay we dont have the exact materials that we needed to do the experiment. Can I borrow this from this lab? Can someone check down the hall if maybe they have this? And just kind of that group mentality of making sure everyone was getting their experiments done. Um and then it was also interesting cause there were a lot of language barriers that were going on in lab. Um cause there were some Israelis that were working there. And then one of the PhD students was from Russia and then two of the post-ocs were from India. Um and so the common language among them was English but in sort of a broken-down manner in different ways. So that was kind of interesting also coming in and sort of having to step into that role of almost like translating English to English for people And checking emails and making sure they made sense and things like that. Sure. Uh I think sometimes I tend to be a little bit on the shy side. Especially um like if Im the person coming into a new group or a new experience. And I think I just kind of have to remind myself like theres a reason why Im here. And I can add something to the experience even if its not in a major sort of leadership necessarily role. Like for example the lab last summer I was the only undergraduate working there. And so that kind of brought out that shyer side. Cause I walked in and you know everyone had already been working there and they were all much older and much more established in their fields. Um so just kind of keep keeping up the reminders that like Im here to get something out of this experience and hopefully I can help out the lab while at the same time realizing that you know Im not necessarily going to come up with a big breakthrough today. And thats okay. And you know I still need to feel comfortable here; I need to add what I can and then the rest will fall into place when it does. And I think just you know keeping those reminders coming that I dont have to be like the person solving the problem right away has kind of helped me to take a step back relax; see what I what I can add to the table without freaking out that its not enough.: Why do you think we should hire you? Um I think for me where Im where I am at this point where Im deciding between sort of going the medical school route or the research route; The more time I spend in a hospital setting I think definitely will enable me to kind of make those distinctions between if its the one-on-one patient care that I care more about or if its the sort of overarching like how are these people being cured more from a scientific standpoint? Um and I think just sort of that open-mindedness towards both sides will help out the hospital a lot. Because you know its always good to have people that are interacting between the pure doctors and the pure scientist level. And someone that has interest in both areas and can kind of mediate and interact between those two.,"[' Im doing very well.', 'How are you?', 'Im currently a junior at MIT.', 'Im studying biology.', 'Ummm I am interested in pursuing some sort of a future in medicine but I dont know if necessarily like the medschool route or more the research side but you know having to do with patient care and drugs and things like that.', 'So within the broader field but Im not sure specifically what path yet.', 'Umm okay.', 'So umm the summer after my sophomore year of high school I actually went on a leadership trip.', 'Um so it was through uh my summer camp and some other camps are a part of the same foundation and we actually went on a trip to Israel for the summer.', 'And it was the first time Id ever been which was very exciting um.', 'And it was a very cool experience cause not only were they teaching a lot of leadership skills but also a lot of you know the daily activities we did like going for really long hikes and things just kind of brought out that innate like someone has to make sure everyone brought enough water.', 'And you know make sure the groups staying together and things like that um.', 'So that was definitely something that I think impacted me a lot.', 'And I think you know in other leadership roles you know even in a small group project or something.', 'A lot of the time I find myself reflecting back to that trip and kind of saying Okay we were in a tough spot like that before.', 'How did we kinda rally the group back together?.', 'Something like that.', 'Umm sure.', 'So a time when I was working on a team.', 'So I think um this situation arises a lot of times in lab.', 'So I was um this past summer I was back in Israel and working in a lab at the Hebrew University.', 'Um and it was a pretty small lab.', 'I was working um for one of the post-ocs and then there are about four other people in the lab.', 'And so things like that kind of came up all the time where it would be a matter of Okay we dont have the exact materials that we needed to do the experiment.', 'Can I borrow this from this lab?', 'Can someone check down the hall if maybe they have this?', 'And just kind of that group mentality of making sure everyone was getting their experiments done.', 'Um and then it was also interesting cause there were a lot of language barriers that were going on in lab.', 'Um cause there were some Israelis that were working there.', 'And then one of the PhD students was from Russia and then two of the post-ocs were from India.', 'Um and so the common language among them was English but in sort of a broken-down manner in different ways.', 'So that was kind of interesting also coming in and sort of having to step into that role of almost like translating English to English for people And checking emails and making sure they made sense and things like that.', 'Sure.', 'Uh I think sometimes I tend to be a little bit on the shy side.', 'Especially um like if Im the person coming into a new group or a new experience.', 'And I think I just kind of have to remind myself like theres a reason why Im here.', 'And I can add something to the experience even if its not in a major sort of leadership necessarily role.', 'Like for example the lab last summer I was the only undergraduate working there.', 'And so that kind of brought out that shyer side.', 'Cause I walked in and you know everyone had already been working there and they were all much older and much more established in their fields.', 'Um so just kind of keep keeping up the reminders that like Im here to get something out of this experience and hopefully I can help out the lab while at the same time realizing that you know Im not necessarily going to come up with a big breakthrough today.', 'And thats okay.', 'And you know I still need to feel comfortable here;

13,13,p25, Um. Im good. How are you? Um. Im a core 16 here at MIT which is aeronautical and astronautical engineering. Um. Im a junior. Um. And my experience has been last summer I worked with NASA Glenn Research Center doing ah interplanetary rover work. Um. I was. Um doing design work with Jeff Landis as my mentor. Um. So ah yeah I had a really good time working on that project. Um. Doing a lot of (inaudible) coding. Making a lot of design decisions. Um. As well as ah separately working on a project with just my fellow interns where we um where we built a autonomous navigation system for a Dropsonde. Um which is a meteorological measuring device. Um but we didnt worry about the Dropsonde itself we were just concerned with building a navigation system. Um. So that it could be recovered by um the people who are using it. Um and I personally worked on the steerable para-foil parachute for that. Um. Yes. I can. Um. When we were working on the Dropsonde project which I mentioned before um there was um some question about whether we were gonna be able to get a good drop site for it. Um because in order to test how the navigation system worked we had to have the thing flying for a significant period of time. Um. So it was fairly...it takes um not very long for most things to fall from reasonable height. So we had to find a really good drop location. Um. And we were having a lot of trouble with that. And um we...we were pursuing some options with working with NASA um but it didnt look like they were gonna work out. And I took the initiative um and I went and I contact the owner of this airport where we had been skydiving there previously there in the summer. Um. So wed like spoken the owner there before but not like not about anything official. We just said hi weve skydived at your airport. Um. But I called him talked to him about it um and got actually um a plane and a free flight for our time to go and be able to drop our (inaudible) um project which was pretty significant for the success of the project. Well I guess I should probably pick a different time that I was working on a team. Um. So um when..for the Venus rover which was the other project that I worked on last summer. Um we had um we basically started just with with nothing. Um because um this this ideas really like in early design phases. Its not like..theres no Venus rover being built by any team. Its just people like sitting down working equations figuring out what would be feasible for a Venus rover. Um so theres a flexibility there. Lot of room to sort of um figure out what we thought would work out best. And initially there is um there are two basically competing ideas. Um there was the idea of using ahh wind turbine um to power the rover. Verses having actually be a land sailer. Um. And I mean there was no clear answer regarding which one of those was better. The wind turbine had some advantage in that it would be able to sit and charge what would the term...the....it would be able to sit still and um accumulate power as the wind blew on it so it wouldnt have to be moving constantly. Um where is the land sailer would have to have some threshold level of wind to move to work (inaudible) friction. It didnt have that then it wouldnt be able to do anything useful. Um so in that way the turbine seemed a little bit less risky but a turbine also has more moving parts. Um and it would require a little bit more on the electronics side and thats riskier as well. Um so it was...um so yeah it was not a clear decision. Um and basically the team was split between wanting to do the turbine wanting to do the land sailer. Um so what we ended up doing was um we...I was pro turbine so I ended up doing an analysis of the wind turbine. Um and my fellow intern was pro land sailer. Did a analysis of the land sailer. Um neither of us did anything super in depth. But we just did the um a basic analysis and then we compared our numbers. We looked through each others processes. Um made sure that we were sort of working from the same assumptions. Um which we were I mean cause I mean we both like did an honest job with it. Um and then we just went based on the math. Which one seemed like it was gonna work out better. Um so it ended up being non confrontational. The turbine did. Which I was happy about. Um. Yeah. I am not extremely well organized. Um so ahh yeah. My ...my work tends to be a little bit of a mess and I have trouble meeting deadlines. Um. But I ...um overcome it just by recognizing something that....recognizing that something that will happen to be where my work will become sloppy and I will miss deadlines if I dont really pay attention to it. Um so I do writing down deadlines keeping a Google calendar. Um. Trying to keep myself on top of things. Um. I think you should hire me because um I am intelligent and hard working. Um and I think...I think my grades at MIT really prove that I am intelligent and hard working. Um and I think that as well as that I also have the experience that you would want at JPO. Working on interplanetary rovers Ive done that before. Also worked on teams um to try to accomplish goals. Um so I think that really I am a pretty well qualified applicant for this position.,"[' Um.', 'Im good.', 'How are you?', 'Um.', 'Im a core 16 here at MIT which is aeronautical and astronautical

14,14,p27, Im doing well thank you. Um Im currently a junior studying chemistry in biology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Im primarily interested in biochemistry research pacifically how small molecules interact with the body um and produce physiological effects. Ive done research as an undergraduate um in the lab thats chemistry and biological um engineering. So Ive been able to work at a chemical biology interface. Ive demonstrated leadership through my role in dorms house government. Ive been dieting chair and environmental chair for almost two years. Um so through that Ive been able to work with others and um work with the like other members of house government as well as the administration. Um and bring um concerns from residents to the administration and represent them.   Ive um been able to work on teams um during my undergraduate classes we um in our laboratory classes in the chemistry department we generally work um in small groups of two or three. So theres definitely been challenges in those situations where for example team member accidentally does something wrong like cost us a lot of product or makes our experiment go wrong and I found it helpful to kind of be like able to put you know aside my annoying side when someones done in the moment and figure how to move forward. Um as opposed to just being frustrated with the fact where we are currently try to see how to go forward with that.    I would say my weakness is actually leadership experience because I havent had a lot of it. Um I also havent had much experience working in a team environment but I have been seeking out opportunities to improve this um looking for even more of a role in house government this year um and actually running for house president. How soon to try to get a leadership position. So Im trying to more experience in those areas. I think you should hire me because I bring experience from um from my education at M.I.T. which has really prepared me for a rigorous work environment to work hard and be able to solve problems and Ive demonstrated this to my work at other internships and my research that Ive already done. ,"[' Im doing well thank you.', 'Um Im currently a junior studying chemistry in biology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.', 'Im primarily interested in biochemistry research pacifically how small molecules interact with the body um and produce physiological effects.', 'Ive done research as an undergraduate um in the lab thats chemistry and biological um engineering.', 'So Ive been able to work at a chemical biology interface.', 'Ive demonstrated leadership through my role in dorms house government.', 'Ive been dieting chair and environmental chair for almost two years.', 'Um so through that Ive been able to work with others and um work with the like other members of house government as well as the administration.', 'Um and bring um concerns from residents to the administration and represent them.', 'Ive um been able to work on teams um during my undergraduate classes we um in our laboratory classes in the chemistry department we generally work um in small groups of two or three.', 'So theres definitely been challenges in those situations where for example team member accidentally does something wrong like cost us a lot of product or makes our experiment go wrong and I found it helpful to kind of be like able to put you know aside my annoying side when someones done in the moment and figure how to move forward.', 'Um as opposed to just being frustrated with the fact where we are currently try to see how to go forward with that.', 'I would say my weakness is actually leadership experience because I havent had a lot of it.', 'Um I also havent had much experience working in a team environment but I have been seeking out opportunities to improve this um looking for even more of a role in house government this year um and actually running for house president.', 'How soon to try to get a leadership position.', 'So Im trying to more experience in those areas.', 'I think you should hire me because I bring experience from um from my education at M.I.T.', 'which has really prepared me for a rigorous work environment to work hard and be able to solve problems and Ive demonstrated this to my work at other internships and my research that Ive already done.']","[array([0.63986886, 0.00412197, 0.18349901, 0.00686065, 0.1656495 ],

15,15,p29, Good thanks. Um Im a junior at MIT. Um Im majoring in biological engineering. I play for the womens varsity volleyball team at MIT. Um and also then also fairly involved with my sorority at MIT alpha phi. Im the vice president of the chapter of operations so Im pretty involved with the house maintenance and things like that. Um I think my most active role in leadership would be within my sorority um its my job to make sure that everything is operating smoothly so thats includes coordinating with our chef like meals that are working that all our facilities including our washers and driers and everything are up and running. Weve had like issues with refrigerators. Um like last year when the power went off there was a lot of issues with that that we had to kind of adjust so I think I being being able to maintain calm and like make sure everything was dealt with a timely and efficient manner. Um so the obvious team choice would be my volleyball team. Um and we actually get along pretty well so theres not too many conflicts. But I think this is silly as it sounds. One of the things is what we eat after meals or after games. Um and so I think its kind of nice sometimes Ill just speak with one or two players r come to a consensus before we really discuss with the team what we are doing after games. And so that way I kind of get a feel like amongst the 3 or 4 of us like what the team would like be most receptive to something like that and so then we come to some kind of consensus this is what were gonna do instead of opening it up to the entire team. Like what would you like to do after the game? And getting you know 16 different opinions and having to deal with that. Im getting like of small set of like you know options and we have people with dietary restrictions and things like that. So uh I think that way its just being able to get a couple of different opinions come to a conclusion before um making a decision. Thats been pretty successful. one of my weaknesses might be um maybe voicing my opinion all the time. Sometimes if Im in a group with a lot of like loud personalities I might have um an opinion on a matter but not always want to voice it in the most. I wont um word my feelings in the best way or be able to convey exactly my emotions um so I think working to do that and I think just through getting more leadership exposure and really pushing myself to get out there has been helping me overcome that. I think that from freshman to now junior year that it definitely by taking more leadership roles on Ive been able to become more vocal person to kind of like express my concerns. I think you should hire me because I think I have a lot of uh technical or skills both um like bases off of my academic performance s. I would have good but also more I feel like I work well with others. Im able to take initiative and if theres ever some sort of concern Ive never had a pro with people coming to me to discuss it. Um I think Im good at recognizing problems early before they get too uh become a good a big problem. Um and kind of address them in a very professional manner and fix it um the problem can go over smoothly.,"[' Good thanks.', 'Um Im a junior at MIT.', 'Um Im majoring in biological engineering.', 'I play for the womens varsity volleyball team at MIT.', 'Um and also then also fairly involved with my sorority at MIT alpha phi.', 'Im the vice president of the chapter of operations so Im pretty involved with the house maintenance and things like that.', 'Um I think my most active role in leadership would be within my sorority um its my job to make sure that everything is operating smoothly so thats includes coordinating with our chef like meals that are working that all our facilities including our washers and driers and everything are up and running.', 'Weve had like issues with refrigerators.', 'Um like last year when the power went off there was a lot of issues with that that we had to kind of adjust so I think I being being able to maintain calm and like make sure everything was dealt with a timely and efficient manner.', 'Um so the obvious team choice would be my volleyball team.', 'Um and we actually get along pretty well so theres not too many conflicts.', 'But I think this is silly as it sounds.', 'One of the things is what we eat after meals or after games.', 'Um and so I think its kind of nice sometimes Ill just speak with one or two players r come to a consensus before we really discuss with the team what we are doing after games.', 'And so that way I kind of get a feel like amongst the 3 or 4 of us like what the team would like be most receptive to something like that and so then we come to some kind of consensus this is what were gonna do instead of opening it up to the entire team.', 'Like what would you like to do after the game?', 'And getting you know 16 different opinions and having to deal with that.', 'Im getting like of small set of like you know options and we have people with dietary restrictions and things like that.', 'So uh I think that way its just being able to get a couple of different opinions come to a conclusion before um making a decision.', 'Thats been pretty successful.', 'one of my weaknesses might be um maybe voicing my opinion all the time.', 'Sometimes if Im in a group with a lot of like loud personalities I might have um an opinion on a matter but not always want to voice it in the most.', 'I wont um word my feelings in the best way or be able to convey exactly my emotions um so I think working to do that and I think just through getting more leadership exposure and really pushing myself to get out there has been helping me overcome that.', 'I think that from freshman to now junior year that it definitely by taking more leadership roles on Ive been able to become more vocal person to kind of like express my concerns.', 'I think you should hire me because I think I have a lot of uh technical or skills both um like bases off of my academic performance s.

16,16,p3, Good. You?m well. Thanks for coming. Yeah sorry I was- think I was late. I totally like messed up. I thought we were at the media lab. But . . .s ok. So please tell me about yourself. Ahh hmm. So uhh I would- would say that the job Im interviewing for lets stay down here. So yeay  Im Chase and I guess um I dont know. I really enjoy computers and outdoors thats -thats generally what I give people. Um so in both of these um in computers mainly uhh at MIT I think some of my favorite classes have actually been graphics . . .-hmm. . . . and computational photography as well. So its actually been really interesting to me getting into harder problems. -hmm. Um like really deep programming like C Im actually getting more interested in. Whereas before when I came to MIT I had no idea about this stuff and I just did a lot of web-development.-hmm. Umm otherwise I just . . . I really just enjoy working on random projects. Going to Aca-thons [SP?] a lot and hanging out with people. Umm yeah. Just building cool things. Uhh otherwise uhh my main thing I do afterwards is ultimate Frisbee which I really enjoy. Uhh actually that would probably be . . . I would actually put this on Frisbee.[laughs] Uhh so I started the Frisbee club in my high school um my junior year. -hmm. And umm basically it was just a bunch of my friends. We used to play around a lot and we said “Hey why dont we just make this a team?” It was about 15 or 20 of us.-hmm. Umm so I became captain and what that entailed was getting people to practices every day or maybe three times a week depending on like how peoples schedules were.-hmm. But it was definitely tricky because I mean we had to get you know at least 15 people out on the field to be able to actually play a game because you need 7 on each side.-hmm. Umm so uhh getting all this organized like everyday was umm definitely like pretty hard to do. And I had to get people passionate enough to be wanting to play every time that we needed to play. Umm and by the end uhh we went to a tournament in Texas . . .-hmm. . . .which is where Im from. Umm and we got 5th my junior year and 3rd my senior year which is great without a coach or anything.-hmm. Umm just a lot of playing around with my friends yeah. Uhh hmm OK. So lets- lets go with robotics. That was one of the classes I was in uhh last semester. So umm basically uhh the first half of the class was just learning in general about robots.-hmm. And figuring out umm you know just like all the electronics first of all and then actually the computer sense behind it doing vision and such. Umm so finally at the very end of the umm uhh class we had to make our own robots. And so what I did there umm basically uhh we had a few meetings to figure out what type of robot we would be building and stuff. Umm and I guess uhh what I wanted to do was umm basically go ahead with everything wed already done. Uhh and just push forward with that and just finish off basically. And what my team members wanted to do was actually redo everything and start from the very bottom.-hmm. Umm so what we ended up doing I actually took their side umm and it worked out very well. Umm we had uhh quite a few tricky problems involved like umm uhh one really cool thing we worked on was figuring out exactly umm how the robot can see the world . . . . . . and what we had with this we had a tile floor that we kind of cheated with. We had a tile floor and then walls . . .-hmm. . . . everywhere. Umm so what we were able to do is say “Lets just color the tile floor and wherever the coloring stops.” “So lets look at all the light in the picture and whenever we dont see any white thats actually the bottom of the wall.” Umm yeah. So then we basically took all these points that existed that represented roughly the bottom of the wall and then basically ran that through an algorhythm that created it uhh turned it into a line. Umm so yeah. That was- that was kind of what it was and it worked really well. In the end we actually had this vision turned on which is really tricky and . . . I think the first time theyd actually had umm some- something like this instead of just looking for balls and doing path planning. Umm actually local- relocalization in the world. Yeah. OK uhh hmm. One of my weaknesses? Umm I would go with umm . . . umm . . .Yeah I shouldve had a better answer for this question . . .umm I guess . . . I dont know if I can plan to overcome it. [laughing] I dont know. I- I- Id actually say umm I- I wish I was a lot better in working- in working in teams. -hmm. Umm so I actually really enjoy working in teams in general and thats umm actually been one of my biggest focuses at MIT because I just know everyone is like really great at everything. Umm but being able to umm basically inspire people to do stuff that I think is a good idea. -hmm. Uhh I have found that Im not the best at basically.-hmm. Umm uhh I mean just like just- just various aspects of just everything. You know like working in this social club where we just throw offense in general for students and you know Ive got like various ideas that I need to get across to people but sometimes people dont agree with me and . . . . . . I either have to be persuasive or something or come up with better ideas.-hmm. Umm so I guess- I guess my plan to overcome this uhh so far has basically just been a lot of practice . . . . . . and just doing more uhh basically again like Ive been doing a lot of teamwork in general. -hmm. I do really enjoy it. So I think it just comes with practice and being very conscious about how other people do stuff very well and inspire me umm so hopefully I can inspire others.-hmm. Now why do you think we should hire you? Umm [laughs] uhh I guess because umm I- I would probably say the one word comes down to passion.-hmm. Umm I- whatever Im doing I make sure umm to do it with everything that I have and Im- Im basically always thinking about the problems that Im working on. Umm I- I- I generally have like a pretty small scope of problems as well that I always try to narrow it down. Im not- I cant take so many problems at the same time and try and solve all of them. If Im reading a book Im only reading like one or two books. Umm but with this umm I dont know I- I- Ive found it so far to be really helpful. Umm I think my passion generally overflows to other people. Umm I- I think Im frequently jumping around uhh when Im doing stuff . . . . . . and like explaining stuff and like listening to people. Umm so I think I- I- I bring kind of some liveliness to places and also with this passion goes- Im always looking at new stuff learning new stuff and- and teaching people about it umm and you know just enjoy making stuff.-hmm.

18,18,p31, Good. Yep. Uh well Im a Junior. Im an MIT student. Um Im majoring in both Math and Computer Science. Uh what sort of skills and interests are you looking to find out about? Cool well Im really interested in distributed systems actually and thats more of a research interest and the sort of application that it generally tends to have when I look at companies is parallel computing. Um I actually did an internship last summer with Amazon and uh for them I ended up doing a lot of parallel computing with the hoodoo platform. Im also taking 6172 which is a performance engineering class and we do a lot of parallelism in C++. Well uh this was in high school but in high school I was the uh president of our robotics team as well as the uh in the earlier years the head of respectively the the uh mechanical engineering team and our mechanical arm team. Uh and you know that was a good leadership experience uh Ive also been in uh in 6172 we have group projects - theyre only two people - but um in some of the projects Ive been the person doing a lot of the organizing. Uh yeah um. Are you more interested in a technical challenge or like in a working with people challenge? Okay. Well um in my 6172 class Im taking right now I was working with Jason. He is a friend of mine and we were both working on the first project and we were trying to improve our speed in order to get up to the benchmark for like good fastness um of improvement. And we had to prioritize different choices in terms of what might actually speed up our code by approximately five hundredfold. Yeah it was pretty intense. And we as such like had to sort of try and paralyze the work and you know it was pretty hard because the code - like merging two code documents is never fun and there was really only one document we were working on. What ended up happening is that I spent most of the time uh driving which is to say coding him watching - verifying my algorithm. It was stressful because it was getting close to the deadline and if we didnt finish this optimization wed have to turn in an old version which was only ten times faster as opposed to five hundred times faster. We ended up getting it not five hundred times faster but one hundred times faster. I was quite pleased. Working with him was sort of both working on the strategies of how to fix the technical problem as fast as possible given that we had two peoples worth of manhours but only n actual hours. Um and thinking about solutions to that technical problem was interesting. Uh I when I get stressed tend to get a little snippy with people Im working with. I think it is not uncommon. Um but definitely when Im - especially when Im tired its like 4 AM in the morning and Im working with people. When theyre trying to explain something to me or Im trying to explain something to them theres like inherent overhead and that can be very frustrating. It causes me to like be short with people when like theyre trying to explain things to me or Im explaining things to them. And its something Im working on because it doesnt actually make communication more effective it just makes everyone unhappy. Um. One of - so - theres a couple things one is that like I have to stay up late working on things so I inevitably get practice working at not being snippy. Um but also like having recognized that this is something that I do something that is not effective for communication uh I have been trying to pay attention to um you know my tone of voice my friendliness and Ive been trying to take the approach that when I do have to try to communicate in these situations to like optimize by minimizing the communication needed and being expressively relaxed during the periods of communication. Because even if I need to be like working hard and stressing out about the work the communication portion doesnt need to take up much time. And so if it takes like twice as long it doesnt matter because thats not the time you need to optimize.- why do you think we should hire you? I think you should hire me because Im technically qualified I get along well with people I am interested in these fields. Like Im excited about Computer Science its like what I want to do. Its a large part of who I am - the Math and Computer Science part of me. And as a result Im going to enjoy work and enjoy working with people. Um also the people I spend my time with outside of work will tend to be very similar kinds of people to the kinds of people Ill be interacting with at work. And so it tends to work out pretty well. In my previous internship with Amazon my team liked me a lot because Im pretty laid back and enjoy joking around with people. Bake food you know. So I yeah you know I will solve your technical problems and I will get along with the team.,"[' Good.', 'Yep.', 'Uh well Im a Junior.', 'Im an MIT student.', 'Um Im majoring in both Math and Computer Science.', 'Uh what sort of skills and interests are you looking to find out about?', 'Cool well Im really interested in distributed systems actually and thats more of a research interest and the sort of application that it generally tends to have when I look at companies is parallel computing.', 'Um I actually did an internship last summer with Amazon and uh for them I ended up doing a lot of parallel computing with the hoodoo platform.', 'Im also taking 6172 which is a performance engineering class and we do a lot of parallelism in C++.', 'Well uh this was in high school but in high school I was the uh president of our robotics team as well as the uh in the earlier years the head of respectively the the uh mechanical engineering team and our mechanical arm team.', 'Uh and you know that was a good leadership experience uh Ive also been in uh in 6172 we have group projects -

19,19,p32,Ready. Good how are you? So Im a junior in chemical engineering. Im very interested in energy application so um from alternative energy to more traditional sources so basically oil fossil fuels. Um and kind of optimizing that industry I think theres a lot of potential there so thats thats where my main interest is. yeah. Um so im uh vice president of corporalations (sp) for the society of woman engineers. And um we just held in September a career fair banquet. So we had a dinner for about 200 people following the career fair. Um and its its a huge event to organize in the sense that students need to be matched up with companies that suit their interest for dinner.  so the goal is just to have kind of a relaxed networking event after you know the hecticness of the carrerr fair. and and to just give people a chance to talk. Um and so so I was working with a committee of six people and which I was the leader of and um I think one thing that I I really did to make sure that the event went smoothly was delegate tasks very early on. Um so one of the one of things that happened in the previous years when I was one of the team and not leading the team was it became very disorganized because we didnt know what the other tasks were what the other people were doing. and in the end we ended up having to work throughout the event to keep things running smoothly and I wanted the team members to be able to sit down and have dinner as well. so in the end it ended up running very well um and um kind of we all got to have dinner to so that was awesome. um so one of our senior design or not our senior but one of our design classes within chemical engineering um asks us to design uh chemical plant in one of the uh software programs we use. um and so its a very big project but its very modular. So you can have somebody working on distillation columns and somebody working on the (sp) separator. Um and so one of the challenges um within that um is making sure that everyone is keeping up with their um their part of the project. and so one challenge that I faced with that project was making sure that one particular person was thou rally involved because um its a lot of work today and we cant really afford to have any anyone kind of slacking off um so kind of to addrses that problem I sat down with him had a conversation with him about it you know we are all feeling kind of the strain of this project the deadline is coming. Um but um you know we cant have anyone sitting on the sidelines so what is it that you want to get more involved in or where do you think your skills are? And it turned out that um he wasnt very um he wasnt very comfortable writing the code in the program.  So he didnt want to write bunky code and just have somebody else try to fix his work all the time but he was very tight with the teaching assistants and so he could funnel our questions through them and getr us some good answers um back from them so that we could keep going through the project so through that conversation we found a way for him to contribute I think um kind of within my personality I hacve a lot of a lot of go go go and uh and a lot of times I dont um realize that waiting is the best option you know just letting certain events take their course um may in fact be the best option. Um so kind of to give you a good example of this is um when I was trying to decide which internships um or which internship offerse to accept I kind of was very anxious to kind of pick one and go with it um and kinf of get started in meeting people  In that company and figuring ouit what I wanted to do and um I think in that circumstance it would have been better after I had accepted an offer I I got other offers that I of course couldnt consider because I was already tied to one particular offer and in that circumstance it would have been better to wait to see how things panned out And to just communicate with other people saying that you know I really do think that pushing the deadline is the best Option in this circumstance. So kind of this year now I definitely waited for everything to pan out before making a decision. Um and it has worked out really well actually . I I was very tempted to give a response to one of the offers I received But over this last weekend I actually went to a conference um and it changed my mind. Both companies that I was deciding between was at the conference And talking to the representatives really helped me. So im glad that I waited to you know hit the buttons-great. And last question. Why do you think we should hire you? -I think that I have a uh ability to contribute really well to the group so not just bringing the knowledge um or the skills that are In your job description  but also kind of the enthusiasms. T he willingness to contribute my ideas to the Uh huh Discussion and um really emerge myself in whats going on would make me a stellar candidate I think,"['Ready.', 'Good how are you?', 'So Im a

project but its very modular.', 'So you can have somebody working on distillation columns and somebody working on the (sp) separator.', 'Um and so one of the challenges um within that um is making sure that everyone is keeping up with their um their part of the project.', 'and so one challenge that I faced with that project was making sure that one particular person was thou rally involved because um its a lot of work today and we cant really afford to have any anyone kind of slacking off um so kind of to addrses that problem I sat down with him had a conversation with him about it you know we are all feeling kind of the strain of this project the deadline is coming.', 'Um but um you know we cant have anyone sitting on the sidelines so what is it that you want to get more involved in or where do you think your skills are?', 'And it turned out that um he wasnt very um he wasnt very comfortable writing the code in the program.', 'So he didnt want to write bunky code and just have somebody else try to fix his work all the time but he was very tight with the teaching assistants and so he could funnel our questions through them and getr us some good answers um back from them so that we could keep going through the project so through that conversation we found a way for him to contribute I think um kind of within my personality I hacve a lot of a lot of go go go and uh and a lot of times I dont um realize that waiting is the best option you know just letting certain events take their course um may in fact be the best option.', 'Um so kind of to give you a good example of this is um when I was trying to decide which internships um or which internship offerse to accept I kind of was very anxious to kind of pick one and go with it um and kinf of get started in meeting people  In that company and figuring ouit what I wanted to do and um I think in that circumstance it would have been better after I had accepted an offer I I got other offers that I of course couldnt consider because I was already tied to one particular offer and in that circumstance it would have been better to wait to see how things panned out And to just communicate with other people saying that you know I really do think that pushing the deadline is the best Option in this circumstance.', 'So kind of this year now I definitely waited for everything to pan out before making a decision.', 'Um and it has worked out really well actually .', 'I I was very tempted to give a response to one of the offers I received But over this last weekend I actually went to a conference um and it changed my mind.', 'Both companies that I was deciding between was at the conference And talking to the representatives really helped me.', 'So im glad that I waited to you know hit the buttons-great.', 'And last question.', 'Why do you think we should hire you?', '-I think that I have a uh ability to contribute really well to the group so not just bringing the knowledge um or the skills that are In your job description  but also kind of the enthusiasms.', 'T he willingness to contribute my ideas to the Uh huh Discussion and um really emerge myself in whats going on would make me a stellar candidate I think']","[array([1.1460892e-02, 6.7076978e-04, 1.1270703e-03, 9.8266162e-04,

20,20,p33, Im uh pretty good. The weathers nice uh outside. Okay so Im a Junior. Im a Junior at IT. Going to graduate uh a semester early actually. So Im going to be graduating next fall. Um. Because uh...I Ive been doing my my work pretty quickly I guess so I So uh I can graduate early thats a good thing. Um Im interested in going into nutrition in the long run. Uh whether it be through medical school or you know even a certification. Whatever but I uh in the meantime I want to get into Life Sciences consulting. And I want to um explore the field and and and uh yeah...do it as as soon as I can pretty much as long as I can. In the field. Um being successful. Uh and getting somewhere. Uh. So. Uh yeah. Okay so I am President of the Endometrius Society and last year we organized a networking event so uh that that comprised of not only students but also like working professionals in the Boston area so basically I got in touch with and invited every single Armenian that I knew in the Boston area and it ended up being a hundred plus event that we actually coordinated in one of the dorms here in Bexley hall so it was also a lot of logistical um you know like practice getting over uh getting around the rules and stuff with capacity and everything and whether or not to serve alcohol and all that stuff. So uh that that was a very big event and uh it was very successfully because people were still talking about it today. So. Thank you. Okay so Im also involved in MIT Undergraduate research journal and uh last spring we we we we publish twice a year at the end of each semester and last spring um we were a little late in our uh in our uh timeline so it was kind of near finals week and we still hadnt gotten anything published. So uh sorry this was last fall so we still had the spring semester to uh sort of remediate our uh error. So um we kind of um all you know pitched in together and I guess the main thing we had to uh draw upon was each others initiative like in the whole process and motivation and motivation you know for some people its more self-centered and for others its more of a community motivation you know? And we each had to tap into our individual editors motivation you know what kind of people they were what they were looking for et cetera so we had to get people kind of uh self started in a way. And uh yeah we we got to work really quickly and uh and and we had it published by like the first two weeks of the spring semester so uh. yeah. yeah. It was a good skill that I picked up kind of how to tap into peoples sense of initiative and stuff. So. Yeah. Uh.  Yeah. So uh one of my weakness I think is uh like well shyness. You know um um and I may see a little like confident you know on the outside but um I definitely have my moments where Im like you know I just freeze and I feel like so you know like I cant talk to anyone pretty much you know and its like its like maybe ten percent of the time that Im like that but uh I kinda want to like get rid of that completely so yeah Im just Im doing Im like putting myself into more like challenging situations socially and stuff to kind of like overcome it. So um yeah just like you know taking advantage of every opportunity that comes my way to be social and stuff like going to parties and just being used to being around people because definitely at MIT you can become like socially uh you know like blocked away so. Yeah. Um so I draw upon a lot of leadership experiences with my enrollment at MIT student groups um Ive completed three years of MIT without going insane thats just a joke but um um...and Im very you know like um Im very organized Im a self-starter Im you know I take initiative Ive organized a lot of events through these student groups so Im Im um Im definitely able to take upon like large tasks with being organized and you know very like having initiative.

21,21,p34, Im doing pretty well. Im a Junior in course two [?unknown word?]. I just started going to last semester but I got very interested in product design when I took a class called product design. It was really cool because we got to work in small teams to make our own projects. So ours was a toy called Con[?] Control and my main role is to do a lot of the solid worksing[?] so I make a lot of the CAD 3-D modeling so that we could make the physical components that didnt already exsist. I really enjoyed that because its kind of an intersection between designing a part and engineering which I have never really thought of until last year. Outside of classes I try to do a lot of design work as well maybe in somewhat different fields. Like I work for the Tech as a production editor. So Its a lot of making info graphics and laying out the entire newspaper and making it look really pretty. Its kind of a good break though from equations and things like that. I think a very recent example is I am going to be chair of my sorority so we just held an event called catwalk which is ten months of planning but it took a lot of delegation a lot of staying on top of things because theres so many components they needed to coordinate. We ended up having fourteen designers but we had to contact way more than that from around the Boston area. And the sorority has a hundred forty girls in it so all of them has to participate in some way whether its working with a designer or helping me to create the decoration scheme or logistics. I personally think it ran really smoothly as a result of extreme organization. I had a co-chair and another girl helping me organize it and we got very good at creating tabs on Google Docs to stay on top of things If I may Ill go back to toy product design cause I think that was a really good good example. I think all of us--it was a team of three freshmen and two sophomores--none of us had that much experience with product design at all so we were all bringing different skills to the table and different ideas different preferences and visions for what we wanted to do and they clashed a lot in the beginning. It was really difficult for us like our personalities clashed as well not just our ideas which was really difficult to work with because meetings were unproductive and we just felt like we werent moving anywhere because other teams were moving forward with their ideas prototyping things and we were still arguing over what design would be most feasible or what was interesting. So we worked through that by just--we worked with our mentors talking to them as kind of a mediator so it wasnt a completely self-motivated resolution or self--I dont know how to describe it. But it ended up working out we all kind of slowed down took a step back and saw from eachothers perspectives talked out very explicitly what the plus and minuses of each idea were and what our goals were given the constraints of the class being that we had a two hundred dollar budget and just a semester to complete it in. And at this point like a month left to go. And in the end we just recognized eachothers strengths and we could each take on responsibility for a certain component of the toy and figure out a way to just meld them all together into the final product. And we did by the end. We had something that we were really proud of. Like a lot of teams ended up relying a lot on their mentors to kind of do the project for them but because we each wanted to take so much ownership of the project it was very much our own and we were able to present it on the final day and thats something that was very rewarding I think one of my weaknesses is my--I forget what it is called. Oh lack of assertiveness or lack of confidence in a way. Like I always want to make sure that everyones ideas are heard and I feel like lots of times I dont want to create conflict so Ill kind of back down after a little bit. Im very open to sharing my ideas but if theres a lot of criticism then I will back down and thats something that Im working on a lot like just trying to stand behind my own ideas trying to be more objective about them so I have reasons to resent so that I dont feel like theres any reason for me to need to back down. I think you should hire me because I am very passionate about product design. I feel like its something that people told me when I started the mechanical engineering lessons they were like Oh you just lit up and I can see that you found your passion here. I feel like Im very detail oriented so Im able to create CAD models in a very methodical manner instead of just drawing random things together. Im able to think of design for manufacturing overall and not just what looks nice on paper but whats actually practicable. I think I am a great team player in that even though I can be passive sometimes in a way its good to have people with different levels of aggressiveness and different levels of confidence because that way its not all like butting heads all the time. And I think that as I improve in my own smoothly and not confrontationally with people but also get things done very effectively.  ,"[' Im doing pretty well.', 'Im a Junior in course two [?unknown

22,22,p35, Im good. How are you? Ok well im a junior at MIT and Im currently studying Computer Science and Biology. Its a new joint major with a minor in management. So thats a little bit of my background. Um last summer I worked at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. I was in their principal investing group. So I was investing in a lot of longer term securities. So it was like buy side trading. Ok so my freshman year um I was doing this project called Six Four Seventy and this is during IEP. Its like a competition where youre supposed to get a team and design your on website. So it was like the first time that all of us had been doing this kind of programming before. Well I had a little background but not much. Um and basically at the end of the day it came to me to get the team together because everyone was doing other things. And its IEP everyone is trying to have fun also. Then I was like guys we have deadlines. We need to get a B in this. So basically I stepped into a leadership roll and I brought our team together and we managed to finish our project and pass the class. It didnt win any of us awards but at least we finished it. I guess that is kind of related to my previous example. I can talk more in depth about it I guess. Um so I guess our main issue was getting the back end database to work correctly. Um which none of us had ever programmed with like MySQL or any of those languages before you know. So um I basically tried to delegate tasks. So I made one of my friends set up the uh get hub server and then another friend. I said ok just try to focus on like the matching algorithms. Then Ill try to put all these things together and create like the front end of the website and bring all the code together and yeah. So that was my team experience.[pause] Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you are doing to overcome it? I think one of my weaknesses is um when I am working on a team sometimes I try to do too much myself. Um like sometimes like people are say: oh what can I help you with? but if they had previously shown inconsistency in the past then Ill try to get it done on my own and not really like delegate things to them so yeah. Thats something I need to work on I think. Uh to overcome it I am trying to be a better leader. Um I am actually going through this leadership uh program right now. Its called CCLP so thats been helping me a lot with my leadership skills. I think you should hire me because I have the necessary background experience. Um from my past summers at uh Wells Fargo and also because I can get work done. I will work well on a team but at the end of the day if things arent getting done I will over-compensate and do it myself. So you can count on me to meet the deadlines necessary at your firm.,"[' Im good.', 'How are you?', 'Ok well im a junior at MIT and Im currently studying Computer Science and Biology.', 'Its a new joint major with a minor in management.', 'So thats a little bit of my background.', 'Um last summer I worked at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco.', 'I was in their principal investing group.', 'So I was investing in a lot of longer term securities.', 'So it was like buy side trading.', 'Ok so my freshman year um I was doing this project called Six Four Seventy and this is during IEP.', 'Its like a competition where youre supposed to get a team and design your on website.', 'So it was like the first time that all of us had been doing this kind of programming before.', 'Well I had a little background but not much.', 'Um and basically at the end of the day it came to me to get the team together because everyone was doing other things.', 'And its IEP everyone is trying to have fun also.', 'Then I was like guys we have deadlines.', 'We need to get a B in this.', 'So basically I stepped into a leadership roll and I brought our team together and we managed to finish our project and pass the class.', 'It didnt win any of us awards but at least we finished it.', 'I guess that is kind of related to my previous example.', 'I can talk more in depth about it I guess.', 'Um so I guess our main issue was getting the back end database to work correctly.', 'Um which none of us had ever programmed with like MySQL or any of those languages before you know.', 'So um I basically tried to delegate tasks.', 'So I made one of my friends set up the uh get hub server and then another friend.', 'I said ok just try to focus on like the matching algorithms.', 'Then Ill try to put all these things together and create like the front end of the website and bring all the code together and yeah.', 'So that was my team experience.', '[pause] Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you are doing to overcome it?', 'I think one of my weaknesses is um when I am working on a team sometimes I try to do too much myself.', 'Um like sometimes like people are say: oh what can I help you with?', 'but if they had previously shown inconsistency in the past then Ill try to get it done on my own and not really like delegate things to them so yeah.', 'Thats something I need to work on I think.', 'Uh to overcome it I am trying to be a better leader.', 'Um I am actually going through this leadership uh program right now.', 'Its called CCLP so thats been helping me a lot with my leadership skills.', 'I think you should hire me because I have the necessary background experience.', 'Um from my past summers at uh Wells Fargo and also because I can get work done.', 'I will work well on a team but at the end of the day if things arent getting done I will over-compensate and do it myself.', 'So you can count on me to meet the deadlines necessary at your firm.']","[array([2.6179913e-02, 5.7258527e-04, 6.8873452e-04, 4.5095960e-04,

23,23,p37, Huh pretty well how are you? Um i am a junior in course 18 which is applied math. Uh Obviously I go to MIT uhm. whoops sorry. Im also probably going to major in management science uhm as well as Im really interested in minoring in economics. Um outsie of academics I do a lot of sports I play water polo I rock clmb a lot uhm I run and bike a lot and uh Im involved in lots of random clubs at MIT so I like to keep busy. Uhm well Ive been swimming well I was a varsity swimmer in hs as well as college  uhm so I swam competitively for 15 years. Uhm so I was the captain of my high school as well as my summer club swim team. Uhm leadership wise I guess the summer swim team was where I felt like I had had the most influential leadership position. Uhm  just because I was on the same team for 14 years. Uhm and so I really got to develop my relationships with all of the younger swimmers uhm even before I was in an official captain position Oh um so I did a lot of uh uh coaching of younger kids uhm a lot of team management as in like setting up events setting up meets heping meets and everything running smoothly uhm as well as just leading  you know cheers helping people stay focus and stay organized at practices. Hm well I was on the financial metrics team in my internship last summer which was basically just the quantitative analysis team. Uhm and so we had a problem in one of our like quantitative analysis programs that was running and non one really knew where it was coming from. So as a team we uh like divide and conquer broke down uh individual sections of the program to look at and uh correlated those with each persons expertise so I analyzed mainly the R portion whereas um my teammate my coworker and lets me lead my sequel portion of the code and broke it up that way I guess. Yeah eventually With help from the uh finance expert Uhm Hm. I would say one of my weaknesses is that I dont always push myself hard enough uhm as far as academically. I like to be challenged but I dont always seek those out. Um so to overcome that I have done a lot of searching through the MIT coursework to uhm find classes that look interesting as well as challenging and to sign up for a lot of classes that are outside just the minimum major requirements so that I could get a bit more of a challenge instead of just doing the bare minimum. Uhm because Im a very fast learner. Um Im dedicated and I know how to work hard because its something that Ive done for my entire life and uh I like being busy and I like working hard.

24,24,p4, Pretty good. Uhh so Im a junior uhh studying aeronautics and astronautics at MIT. Umm so right now Im currently in the middle of my junior year. Im looking for a summer internship company and uhh- OK. Umm so for example last year umm when we were working on a class project where we were uhh trying to design a G- uhh sorry a jet engine for GE. Umm I had to work with a group of 4 people umm and to try to optimize certain uhh certain parameters for this engine. Uhh- that we would have to present at uhh something to present to GE engineers. Umm during that time one of my team members uhh actually got really sick and he actually had to uhh go medical for a couple days and he wasnt really able to do much. And uhh another person ended up uhh sh- wasnt showing up very much so during that time I sort of basically had to facilitate uhh the people who werent sick uhh and basically help them communicate talk to each other and set up meetings. Uhh I sort of took the helm on uhh towards uhh towards the end on a lot of that and basically got everybody together to to complete this project. Umm uhh umm so over the summer I was working at at Auburn University. Um I was doing uhh UAV collision avoidance algorithms. So like uhh programming things to allow to allow a whole bunch of UAVs flying in the same airspace uhh to basically get to their directives without crashing into each other. Umm I was working with a partner but in a larger context of umm a dozen students. Umm as it turns out umm the challenge in this case was that although it was sort of like a programming AI sort of aeronautics umm sort of project uhh my partner came from a chemical engineering background and did not really have any programming experience nor she had she had experience with umm with sort of UAV design. Umm so that became a bit of an issue umm but umm I think basically what ended up happening was I worked with umm a grad student there and like all the people to basically bring her up to speed. Basically sort of teach her programming from the ground up up to a level where she might be able to help with programming like in a uhh a uhh for UAV. And umm in that case I drew upon a lot of resources that were available there. Umm you know there were grad students who were helping helping us the professor who was in charge of the ex- uhh the project as well as with other students in the program. Ummm so I think one of my weaknesses is that umm I have a tendency to to show up uhh to things kind to things kind of late. Umm this is actually probably after Im used to after Im used to going to a certain place umm because I have a tendency to think that and especially in the mornings because I have a tendency to think oh I can get to a certain place uhh by biking uhh at a certain speed. So I think uhh what I tend to do uhh what Im trying to do nowadays to try to overcome that is basically get to somewhere before hand and then basically uhh do work there as opposed to try to do work umm away from a place where I need to be and like sort of try to make it there in the nick of time. Its something that Ive tried to implement over the past couple weeks. Umm I think you should hire me because umm basically Ive demonstrated over the past couple years umm a fair amount of research experience a fair amount of experience in and out umm in and out of the classroom in both umm sort of an academic setting and in a research and development setting uhh such that I think I would be an asset to your company. Umm I think that my past experience with both uhh software and hardwares in aeronautics makes it so that uhh I have a good balance that would be useful to you.-,"[' Pretty good.', 'Uhh so Im a junior uhh studying aeronautics and astronautics at MIT.', 'Umm so right now Im currently in the middle of my junior year.', 'Im looking for a summer internship company and uhh- OK.

25,25,p42, Um so Im a junior at MIT. Im in aerospace engineering. Um Im thinking of doing more of the the aeronautics side rather than the astronautics side although I dont have to decide until later. Um Im in ROTC and you know in the Air Force portion. Im hoping to become a pilot. Uh I applied pretty recently and Ill find out maybe in February or March of next year. Um Im also in Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. Our house is on the East campus across the river and Ive been living there since I was a sophomore. Um thats thats basically me. Um so probably the biggest chance I got to demonstrate leadership so far in my life has been this past summer when I went to pretty much ROTCs version of boot camp. Its called field training and its about a month long and its in Alabama. And its pretty much a test to see what youd do in really stressful situations. So uh theyd give us pretty big things like wed have to be in charge of 40 or 50 people and wed have to make sure they got to this place at the right time and then do um I guess the correct action when we get there. And make sure nobodys going astray or making sure that like all the obstacles the instructors set up uh we can overcome them. So being in charge of people for a good two or three days when everything is just so high stress is probably um the most challenging leadership experience Ive ever had. Um hm to give I guess a non-ROTC-related example um as we have a decent amount of projects in um Core 16 like Unified is a lot is very project based in the second semester and um one of the biggest problems we had in our specific group was the way that um I guess the work was being allocated. So at first it was supposed to be um very evenly divided so each person on the four-person team would do a quarter of the work. But um some people started doing a little bit less and some people started doing a little bit more. And by the middle of the semester it was very unequal. And so it was kind of getting you know under everyones skin. So as a group after we um we realized that it just wouldnt it was really a detriment to our productivity we all had a group meeting and said listen this is what we have to do. We have to reallocate the certain things that are um are the parts of the project that um we had we wanted to originally and um it just kind of went astray. So we did that and we became a lot better. Um working on a team faced with a challenge. Um hm. I can think of um try to not um hit the same categories. So um in SAE in the fraternity that Im in last semester I was the recruitment chair. So the the job for the recruitment chair is essentially to plan Rush. Like plan our events for CPW plan our events for fall rush plan our events for spring rush for a full calendar year or for a full school year excuse me. Um and the question was challenges in a group right? Okay. So challenges and teamwork. So rush is very team-oriented because youre trying to work with your brothers to um really see I guess which freshmen uh are the most compatible with your fraternity. And that youd probably have the best time with. So the way I set it up was we actually did work in small teams of about 4 or 5 brothers and wed go out and you know do fun things and meet freshmen. I would say the biggest problem with that during rush is that some teams were a lot more active than others. And the team that I was in uh was a little bit less active and of course as being rush chair I didnt want that to be the case. I wanted to change that. So um especially in situations where you dont have um you dont have like hard given not given but like outlined powers. Like youre not someones boss. Youre just like another brother in the fraternity. Um the best kind of way to convince people to do something that you want to do is through positive motivation. So thats what I ended up using a lot to get for a while as rush chair to get people to go out. So it was all always being like very excited to do it and like knowing that youre passionate about it and telling them or and like having them realize that oh this is a really good thing that we should be doing. And it will really help us out and it will be fun. So thats how I solved that problem. So my greatest weakness. I normally would probably have to think a lot more about. But I actually had a similar conversation with um one of my bosses in ROTC about a month and a half ago. So I would say my greatest weakness is when I get put in really stressful situations I will tend to jump to a decision or a conclusion too quickly and wont necessarily think about or I think through the whole process um like to fruition. Ill kind of like hurry up and want to get to something so um so the situation can be like I guess resolved. So what Im working on is just being able to like even in a stressful situation and I know it is a problem to kind of slow down and take a step back and really like at things kind of from a higher altitude. Um Im a really hard worker. I absolutely will devote myself to um this company. I I think as a team member Im very cooperative. Uh if the goal we have as a team if I agree with it and for the most part I will. And if I wont then Ill voice and like Ill voice my concerns and try to make it something everyone can agree on. And if I agree on it um then I am or Ill definitely be able to participate in the team in a very productive manner. Ill be a very good follower and if um if its needed I can be a very good leader as well.

26,26,p43, Sure so Im a senior at MIT in management and computer science. Uhm Im really interested in the intersection of the two. So you know not just uhm you know how computers can you know you know how like the best algorithms to do about computers? like you know inventing the next algorithm the next compression algorithm not really something that Im interested in doing. But uh really finding how computers can help apply to peoples lives and make new businesses or improve existing businesses. Sure so uhm I guess Id say earlier this year. So Im actually the president of Baker house and earlier in the beginning of the year in MIT we had this process called REX; Residence Exploration where all the dorms try and throw events and somehow you know recruit or retain the freshmen that they have. Uhm and the REX Event that we had uh we threw a bunch of events had about ten workers that we had were able to give early arrival to. So free housing. Uh so we ran about five or six events the largest of which was a party where we had over seven-hundred people attend. Sure. So I think theres you know always been challenges. So last summer when I was at Disney uhm there were there was some disagreement about uh how we should when we should schedule the uh what week we should schedule the uh trial for. Uhm and there was some disagreement about whether we should have it later because of uhm uh dates for when the program would be ready but if we had it passed a certain date then wed have to have the app also consider time zone issues. So basically just discussed with all the stake holders and let them know that you know by changing this date pushing it back were adding scope to the app and were going to have to make additional development changes and see if they would be able to be flexible to change it back. Yep. Sure. So I think the the problem uhm that I have the most is uh in delegating task to people. So uhm I want to make sure that things are done properly so I tend to overly control on things. So basically Ive been thinking to myself alright is this something core that I really have to do? no. I think lets. you know lets get someone else to do it and that way also they also they learn it so you know when I graduate theyre able to take on that role. Sure. Sure. I think uhm I combine you know technical expertise with uh business expertise and product expertise. So hiring me as a product manager for your mobile app I think is uh would be optimal because I have expertise in all these areas and Ive worked in all these areas in the past uhm and Im able to bring that expertise to your organization in a way that I think few other candidates uhm have.

27,27,p44, Okay um my names Evan Evan Muray Im a junior here at MIT in computer science. Im originally from Louisville Kentucky. And uh yeah I currently live across the river. I heard about this study through e-mail. So thought Id check it out. You did? Nice. A leader? Uh sure. Um. A good example of that would be uh some of my extra curricular work activities so Im involved in uh two activities in general that showcase my leadership skills. One is Camp Kesem MIT which is a student organization here on campus at MIT uh each summer the organization puts on a summer camp for children whos parents have or have had cancer. Um and I serve on the coordinator board for this organization. Um in the past I was in charge of handling applications and contacting families of campers whod would come to our camp and being in contact with them throughout the year send them newsletters send them updates plan reunions for them. Uh this year I am in charge of asking the students on campus and getting students to apply to become counselors for our camp and (inaudible) with students so I work as a coordinator I actually have a co-coordinator we usually work in tandem. The other activity is dance troop. Its another student organization here at MIT where we put on a show each year and dance have some fun its a dance show and Im a choreography for that organization as well. I lead a dance teach people some dance moves for some fun. Thanks. Sure uh I think a great example of that would be this past January I participated in a web design competition here on campus 6470 I was on a team with my girlfriend and a mutual friend of ours. Its always different working in a group with your friends as opposed to just hanging out with them. There was a bit of conflict about how we wanted the website to go. We had different visions for how we wanted it to look and I think for me the best way that I handled that was to sort of be willing to compromise because I think its a very important skill and also just listening active listening. I was listening to why she wanted to make certain changes to the website. And by doing that um I was able to uh figure out uh sort of like a common ground that we could work towards I think we eventually did hit um and were able to move forward with this one conflict that I definitely remember because it was pretty big at the time but I mean we needed to get through it. My greatest weakness... Hm. Okay. Uh. Id say my one of my bigger weaknesses is uh Id say probably uh self-starting actually. Its something Ive been working its like my goal for this year to work on. In the past I would do my classes take my classes and really just kind of do my schoolwork significantly outside of classes. If theres one thing I learned from being around all these amazing people here at MIT is if you have an idea just go for it. Its very easy especially here theres resources to do so and its something that I want to work on I have some ideas for projects I want to start on my own. Its always been an issue for me to actually start on things and come up with ideas and really get started on certain projects. But this I plan on starting my own website and doing some ideas with that and hopefully I will gain some more experience in computer sciences. Uh I think one of my best qualities is the ability to really quickly coming to MIT for example I came to MIT with very little experience in the field computer science. Many of my past internships Ive been going to I dont have much experience but I pride myself in the sort of grasp ideas quickly and uh build on top of those and use those to build solutions to problems. I find that uh after doing some examples of a certain problem or just playing around with it for a little bit I can get to work on using that sort of technology. In the past couple internships Ive had to deal with new languages new framework and I think that definitely more then compensates for any experience Im lacking. No problem thank you for having me.,"[' Okay um my names Evan Evan Muray Im a junior here at MIT in computer science.', 'Im originally from Louisville Kentucky.', 'And uh yeah I currently live across the river.', 'I heard about this study through e-mail.', 'So thought Id check it out.', 'You did?', 'Nice.', 'A leader?', 'Uh sure.', 'Um.', 'A good example of that would be uh some of my extra curricular work activities so Im involved in uh two activities in general that showcase my leadership skills.', 'One is Camp Kesem MIT which is a student organization here on campus at MIT uh each summer the organization puts on a summer camp for children whos parents have or have had cancer.', 'Um and I serve on the coordinator board for this organization.', 'Um in the past I was in charge of handling applications and contacting families of campers whod would come to our camp and being in contact with them throughout the year send them newsletters send them updates plan reunions for them.', 'Uh this year I am in charge of asking the students on campus and getting students to apply to become counselors for our camp and (inaudible) with students so I work as a coordinator I actually have a co-coordinator we usually work in tandem.', 'The other activity is dance troop.', 'Its another student organization here at MIT where we put on a show each year and dance have some fun its a dance show and Im a choreography for that organization as well.', 'I lead a dance teach people some dance moves for some fun.', 'Thanks.', 'Sure uh I think a great example of that would be this past January I participated in a web design competition here on campus 6470 I was on a team with my girlfriend and a mutual friend of ours.', 'Its always different working in a group with your friends as opposed to just hanging out with them.', 'There was a bit of conflict about how we wanted the website to go.', 'We had different visions for how we wanted it to look and I think for me the best way that I handled that was to sort of be willing to compromise because I think its a very important skill and also just listening active listening.', 'I was listening to why she wanted to make certain changes to the website.', 'And by doing that um I was able to uh figure out uh sort of like a common ground that we could work towards I think we eventually did hit um and were able to move forward with this one conflict that I definitely remember because it was pretty big at the time but I mean we needed to get through it.', 'My greatest weakness...

28,28,p45, Pretty good how are you? So uh my names Bonnie. Im a junior at MIT. Im in core six which if you dont know is in computer science. Im minoring in economics umm also mathematics. So Im interested in you know application of data and quantitative reasoning to any sort of like interesting fields so that includes like economics finance biology. So a vary wide array of interests. And Im here today because well I was uh told it would be a good time here with the behavior study. Oh what year were you?-6. Okay. Okay so Id say one fairly informal instance actually was over this last spring break. A couple friends and I four of us actually so a fairly small group um we biked from Philadelphia to Boston over spring break because we thought that would be a good idea. What it actually was huh there were some amazing ups some amazing downs. umm Definitely a very memorable experience. And there were just some points over the course of the trip when it was 45 degrees except your biking on the state highways its raining and like ??? so we felt like giving up a little bit just heading back up taking the train. And I really riled people up in terms of reminding us why we were doing this and reminding us of the fact that we were already 60% of the way through we might as well push on all the way to the end of our journey. Just like I guess evoking everyones different motivation because everyone you know wants to do something awesome but everyone has a slightly different motivation for why they join a team in the first place. And I guess providing like individualized reasons and individualized motivations to uh you know different parts of our team as to why they came on in the first place and why thats still something that resonates with them. And using that you know I was able to get the group back together and we did bike all the way back up here. So that was a very rewarding experience. Sorry a what challenge? Oh oh another challenge. Okay. Um well lets see most of the challenges Ive seen coming in any sort of team work right involve either internal challenges something thats coming from within the team or an external challenge. So I guess if we were to talk about an external challenge umm something not involving you know lack of motivation uhh it would uh lets see. So uh so my my freshman year I was involved uh I was involved in this organization called tech fair where we basically organized a um a tech expo at the beginning of the uh beginning of the school year. And I was again I was I was able to motivate people towards the end when there was a lot of work happening a lot of twelve-hour days to get the logistics down before the event. And I guess again there it uh it does come down to really motivating people um and speaking to their individual you know passions to get them to you know do things which they might not want to and short cut. Um my greatest weakness Ive noticed can be a uh lack of lack of focus. Especially if I have like a large number of tasks its very easy to instead of you know caching away all my other tasks somewhere and focusing on one at a time. Its very easy for me to you know pop one but still have you know like subtasks and the other things I have to do running in my mind. Um so of late Ive been trying to basically get more organized. Ive you know had this hypothesis that by using a Google calendar Google this Google that all these other products to try you know serve as fairly intelligent places where I can hash away my uh my other tasks. It will provide me with something which is very trustworthy that I will trust enough to not what worry about those tasks. Because what usually happens right I just write it down on a piece of paper. Um I dont trust that Ill be able to find and the risk of forgetting to do something important is is pretty great to bear. So that thats been pretty useful so far. Ive noticed that Ive had an urge sometimes to think about other things I have to do but I just remind myself that wait wait you wrote that down there. You probably knew what you were doing so dont worry about that. Theres a supervisor which is yourself taking care of your other tasks. So I think that one thing um I do retain in addition to well like like I said Ive had what used to be a problem in terms of being able to focus on a task but it does come with the added benefit of being able to juggle lots of tasks at the same time. I know lots of people who do focus on one task it often becomes one task one project going on for you know a couple months uh becomes the forefront of their thought their imagination becomes what they can handle. However having been accustomed to juggling lots of stuff in the past I think one great skill I can bring to the table is umm provide a very very agile agile member to the team who can juggle lots of different projects and bring insight to all of them without with my newfound organizational abilities getting too uhh too caught up in the mix.

Im studying course 18 mathematics uhmm currently enjoying it alot uhmm classes Im currently taking not so much. Uhmm I dont know Is there anything in particular you want to know? Ok. Ok. Uhmm ok so I was over at Ip I did book reports. Uhmm I kind of assumed like a project mangerish role particularly because I wasnt really familiar with Python too much which is the coding language that they used to test. Uhmm so I assumed more of a director kind of doing the math for it and kind of instructing people to do the mathematical thinking for that kind of thing.-huh excellent. So tell me about a time that you were working in a team and were faced with a challenge. How did you go about solving the problem? Uhmm Let me see I usually take this particular example. One of the tough things is you having to explain things that are sort of something that is very familiar to you to someone who doesnt have familiarity with that and especially in a really short time. Uhh can be extremely difficult. Uhmm Its how to deal with that. Uhh sort of just by giving a crash course uhm kind of asking other friends to also help so its uhmm kind of give some information and ask for feedback that sort of thing. ok uhh lets see one of my weaknesses uhhm technical writing uhmm and what Im doing to overcome that. Actually not very much Im taking a math writing class. Uh so thats been really helpful. Its in a subject that I really enjoy  and I actually have a paper due this Friday so hopefully I show so improvement and that would help. Uhmm not particularly. Sorry. Uhmm soo I would like a job which is sort of very open uhmm sort of open in a sense that its open to new ideas open to uhmm the ability to uh work on different stuff. Sort of like whatever you want. Uhm Also in like a sense that you can go in and wear whatever you want you dont have to wear a suit and tie everyday uhm yeah.(Sirens in background)(laughs) uh wouldnt be too bad.

30,30,p48, Im doing well Uh Im a student I study computer science. Uh Im in my last year so when I graduate in May Im going to be working on computer science stuff I demonstrate leadership on the track team I was senior pole vaulter on the team so uh right now were doing uh the conditioning and stuff like that and all through the preseason a lot freshmen come and its important to get them up to speed so the uh seniors on the team myself included uh  lead them though the workouts and stuff like that and its important to be able to...to stand up and let them know how the tradition is and stuff like that. Hm... in my living group we uh we had a problem that the rent was getting too expensive because we didnt have quite enough people living there but we still had a set amount of rent we had to pay as a group. So the prices were going up to the point that people had to get kicked out. So that was pretty rough but this happened like a year ago. So like one of my close friends was like I cant afford these prices like theres just no way. And like then it dominoes which was a huge problem.  And a lot of people suggested a lot of different...a lot of different solutions. Most of them were like motivated from anger. So uh some people were like everybody who moves out should have to pay and other people were like oh no if Im if not living there I shouldnt have to do anything so so it was like pretty contentious. But but we worked it out to a... it was like a variation of a plan that I suggested which was that we would uh we would change the rent based on room size and how many people were living in the room. So wed allow people to have more space themselves and pay more but people who would have otherwise been forced out could uh could have other people crammed into a room and saved a lot of money. So so we kept some of the people we kicked out. Yeah but it was pretty rough to get that motion passed. Uh Im the opposite of type A so I can be pretty disorganized. My lab notebooks like a lot of the time I make a lot of scribbles in at and when I write code the documentation like tends to be on the shaky side. Um so so it makes it kinda hard for other people to follow when doing ? I never really thought it was a problem though until the most recent project that Ive been on that I had to leave uh the project for a short amount of time and my partner like picked up where I left off and had no idea what was going on and I was like this is actually a problem the teachers like dont just tell you to document just to aggravate you. So I worked uh so like since then like Ive been working on like documenting what I do just like more diligently but also to check back up on it. So that like theres some kind of like review before like I show other people or before I let it out to a point that other people might rely on it. So just to like read my documentation that and which Ive never done before until this most recent project had that problem Yeahd like to have do you have one in mind? Sure yeah Mostly because uh results. Im I just like get things done. And theres a like theres a lot of things I know how to do especially the job Im thinking of is like a programming job like a startup. My background my degree is actually nuclear engineering.

31,31,p49, So my name is Fernando Iber I am a junior here I come from Puerto Rico and I am currently studying biological engineering. Uh Im considering doing pre-medicine maybe going into either an MD and lets say apply to some schools as an MD or go into an MD-PHD program. Um my main interest is basically oncology but like I over the past few years Im doing a couple of research programs I did an internship and it basically like gave me a view that I could tackle that problem in a lot of ways. So not just being a clinician but being a researcher a medical researcher. So thats how I got interested into the whole MD-PHD thing and like Ive gotten a hold of some programs that I viewed and theres a lot out there. I couldnt have imagined that if I stayed home. Its amazing what people do here. So Im Im pretty involved in in campus groups. Uh I was the first founder of of their restructuring of Beta Theta Pi so Im currently you would say chapter president. Uh so Im leading the whole the whole cavalry of recruitment right here on campus and were getting a lot of results. Um Im also in the Board of Puerto Rican students I serve as social chair and I am also pretty involved in dorm government especially rec-CBW planning so I just like to get around. So any anything that gives me that type of opportunity to just explore any guise is all pretty good for me. Uh I was also considering something for soccer uh in terms of being team treasurer but unfortunately I had a bit of an accident with my leg so I got out of soccer. So I actually have a really humbling experience. Last semester I took a class about mechanics. A lot of people in that class were juniors and I was a sophomore. So everybody there was much more experienced than me so I was the only sophomore in my group there were two ones that were juniors and it was the final project. And when we sat down and started talking about things to do I basically had almost no knowledge of the things they were planning ‘cause they already took cell biology and they took really advanced courses in fluid dynamics and they were trying to do some tissue modeling. Like even though it was a class about mechanics and I could understand some of the things I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. And they just put me there and one of them was really helpful and actually guided me through the initial process but the other one was not available at all at any time. So I basically had to sit down I actually met with the professor a couple of times just to like talk and chat and we took the professor out for for a lunch so we could just like talk about stuff and I actually had to find out my own way through everything with a little help of the only junior friend that was actually available to me. And it was humbling because normally when I worked on teams we were all pretty equal equal minded or it was in a humanities class. ‘Cause normally technical classes here dont have much to do with team projects in sophomore year. Normally laboratories and final design project classes are for older students so it was a surprise for me where it came like Im a sophomore and Im already doing final presentations for bio-mechanics. And it just caught me pretty off guard. And the only way…we ended up doing an extremely awesome project but it took lots of coffee Red Bull and Wikipedia. Thats my strategy for now ‘cause it was completely new territory right there compared to humanities or any other classes where youre everybody has the same mindset. So that was my group trauma. ve done to overcome it. So I didnt have any actually trouble self-recognizing trouble about so stemming off of from the inexperience type of situation that was actually the first group project I had where that experience happened and I feel like if I get into something that I dont basically know I have a really hard time finding stuff out for myself. So if I dont come prepared to do something it takes me a while to get to a pace to actually start absorbing material and actually contributing which is kind of a handicap because some students are already up to speed and they already expect some things from me. And I I I obviously would like to give them my all and hand out everything they want on a silver platter but its hard for me. So Ive been trying so basically like the solution for me was basically studying more putting much more effort from my part but its still a big a big minus in my in my turf. Its uh it takes me a while to dominate things that that I dont have an up-to-speed inclination to that. And that has caused like mishaps that well through hard work you can overcome them but a lot of work compared to your regular person. d like to have- do you have one in mind? Yeah. So I feel like even though Ive gone through many obstacles Ive always tried and found a way to excel exert myself to bigger than Id previously thought. So I might sometimes feel that I dont have that knowledge on me but I will go out and get it even if it takes a lot of coffee or a lot of effort because theres also a sense of satisfaction in actually giving it more than you can but seeing that actually succeed. You know what I mean? Its uh its like what MIT does to you youre humbled by an immense amount of work youre humbled by by extremely hard classes that you had no idea that they were going to come and blast you with pieces homework and exams that you are overwhelmed. But you sit down you think about stuff. I sit down and I think about stuff and I get a plan there. That the good thing about the plan it takes some time to devise a plan because it its not as efficient its not efficient to go randomly guessing what to do but but having like an educated guess you remember the SATs where its like “you may not always know the answer but you can make an educated guess as to what the answer may be.” So thats how I approach things when I have no idea what Im doing but after some effort it will actually get me to a place where I can say “hey Im here lets get crackin.” Um thats sort of like the general mindset I have for many problems be it the life sciences you have to do an essay if I have to come up with elucidating a mechanism that does this to breast cancer cells or if I go by the walks of life can take you anywhere if I end up being a consultant for a for Johnson and Johnson lets say a company for random purposes and its the same way you tackle every problem. You get up and you find out what you have a hard time doing then you sit down and do it. Uh sometimes its frustrating because results dont come out like this um but I feel like once you get the hang of it you can start your productivity increases by x-fold x be a number much higher than one lets talk MIT here. Yeah I feel thats the thats at least my way of tackling things and its gotten me through a lot and its actually helped me wear down the walls of MIT and have a better experience at it so I feel its the same way I should attack all the problems that come to me. ,"[' So my name is Fernando Iber I am a junior here I come from Puerto Rico and I am currently studying biological engineering.', 'Uh Im

32,32,p5, Myself um Im a junior majoring in computer science at MIT Im very interested in product design and not just how products are designed but how the business side of it how they affect the users and how he can use the technology to affect the masses. I want to pursue (?) everyone. A time when I demonstrated leadership was um I was programs chair of the MIT Minority Business Association and it was my responsibility to plan our annual New York City Trip. And um some of the challenges were bringing in sponsors and delegating tasks to all the members and managing people essentially. And by um by delegating tasks according to interest and making sure that understanding people what was going on in peoples lives and helping them understand why we were able to complete a task on time we were able to have a successful trip. Um a time when I was working on a team was in my Elemental Sulfur? Construction class and I faced not people problems but a technical problem. And it was a project in which we were trying to implement and the way we solved it was just by brainstorming and making sure we didnt deny anyones idea off the bat we just tried to be as creative as we could be. And then we presented some of our solutions to a TA and through that we were able to solve the technical problem. One of my weaknesses is actually I learned from my internship last summer is that usually when I work on a project or have an idea I wait until the idea is fully fleshed out or partially implemented before I share with others and get their opinion. But its I find its a better and more agile approach to share ideas as soon as possible and to integrate as quickly as possible. So fail fast essentially. That what I would do to accomplish this in the future to seek opinion early on when I have an idea working on a project. Why I think you should hire me. I think you should hire me because Im very I have a strong willingness to learn and I go beyond that and try to really get into why things are the way they are and why they work. I break it down to small steps and try to build it back up to similar success.,"[' Myself um Im a junior majoring in computer science at MIT Im very interested in product design and not just how products are designed but how the business side of it how they affect the users and how he can use the technology to affect the masses.', 'I want to pursue (?)', 'everyone.', 'A time when I demonstrated leadership was um I was programs chair of the MIT Minority Business Association and it was my responsibility to plan our annual New York City Trip.', 'And um some of the challenges were bringing in sponsors and delegating tasks to all the members and managing people essentially.', 'And by um by delegating tasks according to interest and making sure that understanding people what was going on in peoples lives and helping them understand why we were able to complete a task on time we were able to have a successful trip.', 'Um a time when I was working on a team was in my Elemental Sulfur?', 'Construction class and I faced not people problems but a technical problem.', 'And it was a project in which we were trying to implement and the way we solved it was just by brainstorming and making sure we didnt deny anyones idea off the bat we just tried to be as creative as we could be.', 'And then we presented some of our solutions to a TA and through that we were able to solve the technical problem.', 'One of my weaknesses is actually I learned from my internship last summer is that usually when I work on a project or have an idea I wait until the idea is fully fleshed out or partially implemented before I share with others and get their opinion.', 'But its I find its a better and more agile approach to share ideas as soon as possible and to integrate as quickly as possible.', 'So fail fast essentially.', 'That what I would do to accomplish this in the future to seek opinion early on when I have an idea working on a project.', 'Why I think you should hire me.', 'I think you should hire me because Im very I have a strong willingness to learn and I go beyond that and try to really get into why things are the way they are and why they work.', 'I break it down to small steps and try to build it back up to similar success.']","[array([0.00621616, 0.00642734, 0.9408236 , 0.00180923, 0.04472373],

33,33,p50, myself umm I dont know how much you know from any sort of registration or anything I am Young. I am Junior right now. I am in my third year. I am I guess I talk about what I am majoring umm I am majoring in mathematics and physics. I am also doubling in core six computer science. and umm I think I am getting minor in French and French literature. grew up in the states in northern virginia. Growing up I guess I was interested in I played a lot of competitive chess. I was also interested in recreationally tennis and soccer. and um other forms of umm at high school I was at my junior and senior years I was captain of umm chess team of my high school and umm we participated in something. people thinks of chess as an individual sport. but umm we participated in quite a few team events. through the states which means one every year. which we have been winning every year every year. umm and also at the nationals. and before I went there they were little bit out of leadership. They used to get may be fifth or so. but when I was there I was umm managed to lead us to almost the first. We came in second in three years in a row. We came first in blitz which is speed chess. under my leadership. and to be fair the people coming in were talented to begin with. but perhaps had they not had that environment wouldnt have done as well challenge umm there are countless examples when umm in group projects in high school. umm there was one time when umm freshman year in high school. We were working on a umm we had something we called ibet integrated biology electronics and umm biology english technology we had a group project. Four persons in the group. and a few days before the presentation we found the person who had done a decent bit of data analysis had done it incorrectly. and he was not available. he was out of town at the time. again we didnt fully know what had gone wrong but he had come up with some results which were clearly umm could not be explained by experimental error. clearly he had done something incorrectly. So we had rush to fix what had gone wrong and to redo many of the tests which was a big challenge given the time constraint. We had to redivision the work in addition to what each of the remaining members had to do anyway and compile the final presentation of course its not a life threatening challenge weaknesses umm I guess one weakness would be being very honest with myself in terms of trying to determine what I want to do and focusing all my faculty on that. Rather than keeping ones options open which I think a good thing. but I think umm sometimes it can be an excuse for not taking risks. this is important because where I went to high school. The culture was very pervasive of trying to do everything and in great part it causes you not to commit to any one thing. which in one way could be good in terms of keeping your options open. but on the other hand if you knew if you had known what you want to do specifically and devoted all your resources to that specifically of course you could do better than that. and in the end you probably go to pick something. I think one weakness is to be honest with myself about what specifically I want to do and devote resources to that. umm what I am trying to do to address that. it may seem at the beginning umm somewhat paradoxical. but what Ive been doing is trying out wide variety of things so I cant use the excuse. there are bunch of things I dont know yet. Ill keep my options open. Ill try them out and if I dont like them Ill drop. thats a way to decide whats left to do that Id like. alright so its still early in terms of job search but one job that I would like that I am considering is trading umm trading or some sort of quantitative finance. and umm I think Id be a strong candidate because I have an extremely strong quantitative background in mathematics and modeling umm computer science work Ive done physics as well. and umm I have history of being competitive both in academic environment and in chess and in other sports. I have always known. especially if we the role we are talking about a trader trading I have always been interested in strategy games such as chess poker etc. trying to find an optimal strategy and use it to win the game. and that I think the kind of skillset that is necessary for this kind of job.,"[' myself umm I dont know how much you know from any sort of registration or anything I am Young.', 'I am Junior right now.', 'I am in my third year.', 'I am I guess I talk about what I am majoring umm I am majoring in mathematics and physics.', 'I am also doubling in core six computer science.', 'and umm I think I am getting minor in French and French literature.', 'grew up in the states in northern virginia.', 'Growing up I guess I was interested in I played a lot of competitive chess.', 'I was also interested in recreationally tennis and soccer.', 'and um other forms of umm at high school I was at my junior and senior years I was captain of umm chess team of my high school and umm we participated in something.', 'people thinks of chess as an individual sport.', 'but umm we participated in quite a few team events.', 'through the states which means one every year.', 'which we have been winning every year every year.', 'umm and also at the nationals.', 'and before I went there they were little bit out of leadership.', 'They used to get may be fifth or so.', 'but when I was there I was umm managed to lead us to almost the first.', 'We came in second in three years in a row.', 'We came first in blitz which is speed chess.', 'under my leadership.', 'and to be fair the people coming in were talented to begin with.', 'but perhaps had they not had that environment wouldnt have done as well challenge umm there are countless examples when umm in group projects in high school.', 'umm there was one time when umm freshman year in high school.', 'We were working on a umm we had something we called ibet integrated biology electronics and umm biology english technology we had a group project.', 'Four persons in the group.', 'and a few days before the presentation we found the person who had done a decent bit of data analysis had done it incorrectly.', 'and he was not available.', 'he was out of town at the time.', 'again we didnt fully know what had gone wrong but he had come up with some results which were clearly umm could not be explained by experimental error.', 'clearly he had done something incorrectly.', 'So we had rush to fix what had gone wrong and to redo many of the tests which was a big challenge given the time constraint.', 'We had to redivision the work in addition to what each of the remaining members had to do anyway and compile the final presentation of course its not a life threatening challenge weaknesses umm I guess one weakness would be being very honest with myself in terms of trying to determine what I want to do and focusing all my faculty on that.', 'Rather than keeping ones options open which I think a good thing.', 'but I think umm sometimes it can be an excuse for not taking risks.', 'this is important because where I went to high school.', 'The culture was very pervasive of trying to do everything and in great part it causes you not to commit to any one thing.', 'which in one way could be good in terms of keeping your options open.', 'but on the other hand if you knew if you had known what you want to do specifically and devoted all your resources to that specifically of course you could do better than that.', 'and in the end you probably go to pick something.', 'I think one weakness is to be honest with myself about what specifically I want to do and devote resources to that.', 'umm what I am trying to do to address that.', 'it may seem at the beginning umm somewhat paradoxical.', 'but what Ive been doing is trying out wide variety of things so I cant use the excuse.', 'there are bunch of things I dont know yet.', 'Ill keep my options open.', 'Ill try them out and if I dont like them Ill drop.', 'thats a way to decide whats left to do that Id like.', 'alright so its still early in terms of job search but one job that I would like that I am considering is trading umm trading or some sort of quantitative finance.', 'and umm I think Id be a strong candidate because I have an extremely strong quantitative background in mathematics and modeling umm computer science work Ive done physics as well.', 'and umm I have history of being competitive both in academic environment and in chess and in other sports.', 'I have always known.', 'especially if we the role we are talking about a trader trading I have always been interested in strategy games such as chess poker etc.', 'trying to find an optimal strategy and use it to win the game.', 'and that I think the kind of skillset that is necessary for this kind of job.']","[array([0.00445164, 0.0247979 , 0.929887  , 0.00110587, 0.03975762],

34,34,p52, Fine Uh Im Daniel. Im a Freshman. Im from uh Fort Lauderdale Florida. Thinking about course AN61 here. I uh actually uh I was here for running but I realized it wasnt me so um I decided to drop early and am pursuing travelon. So um yeah classes I am doing fine. Looking for a job now. Thats about it. Uh Id say probably Id say rowing in high school was probably my best demonstration. I was um senior in my in the junior varsity boat after some little qualms with sea-re-sing? Id really like thought it showed them that like even though I wasnt put in the best situation like I performed indiscriminately. And I think in a way I showed them that we would still be able to compete against a varsity eight and there was times where like we were always even like half the season we were always like around the same time. And we ended up uh medaling at states. And Id say that um a good part of that is by leading by example by the older um upper classmen so I feel like maybe that was the point where I was demonstrating leadership. Well there was a lot of issues with my coach in in rowing. So um if it wasnt I think um I went through a lot of issues like that with my assistant coach at came for a year and she helped me sort things a lot. She showed that I did have um proper technique. It was more of like like a discriminating issue of my coach wanting certain people on the boat just because he thought it would move better. I realized that um as long as I kept on pursuing the sport like thats all that really mattered. Thats all like my own efforts will fruit in something that will take me somewhere that will help me get into MIT. So I feel like um this this like seeing things in my own way right and being distraught by other people effecting me helped. s uh very good. So uh tell me about one of your weaknesses and what youve done to overcome it. I think one of my weaknesses has to be um the fact that Im a little um delinquent with my work. And uh um Im lazy at times. I definitely procrastinate. It was a pursuing thing through high school. And uh its still a little now because of a passing record. One of my combating is goal setting. I learned it from one of my uh from one of these one of an upperclassmen that I know in uh at MIT. He uh told me like to write out like weekly goals and write out long term goals. Like long terms goals meaning like the end of MIT after MIT what you want to do after the MIT experience and short term goals which is like get stuff done now. So in a way that kind of put me things put things in perspective for me. Realize that I shouldnt be burning too much time messing around. By I mean certainly I should be messing around a little bit just because its its a good time to have fun and relax. But at the same time I shouldnt do it in excess. So I guess thats helped me a little bit. d like to have. Might be a rep or something else. Do you have something in mind? Um actually yeah um. Ive never had lab experience before so I really want a role which is why- Uh well for starters um I dont have any experience so I feel like um its a good place for me to start. And Im really willing to do whatever it takes to make time for it. Um I see how um Im not taking too many classes this semester cuz Im a course advantage. Ill be making sure Ill have enough time to make classes uh more manageable. I should be able to commit hours on it. Im really interested in the job Im doing so hopefully that interest will inspire me uh inspire me to work hard.,"[' Fine Uh Im Daniel.', 'Im a Freshman.', 'Im from uh Fort Lauderdale Florida.', 'Thinking about course AN61 here.', 'I uh actually uh I was here for running but I realized it wasnt me so um I decided to drop early and am pursuing travelon.', 'So um yeah classes I am doing fine.', 'Looking for a job now.', 'Thats about it.', 'Uh Id say probably Id say rowing in high school was probably my best demonstration.', 'I was um senior in my in the junior varsity boat after some little qualms with sea-re-sing?', 'Id really like thought it showed them that like even though I wasnt put in the best situation like I performed indiscriminately.', 'And I think in a way I showed them that we would still be able to compete against a varsity eight and there was times where like we were always even like half the season we were always like around the same time.', 'And we ended up uh medaling at states.', 'And Id say that um a good part of that is by leading by example by the older um upper classmen so I feel like maybe that was the point where I was demonstrating leadership.', 'Well there was a lot of issues with my coach in in rowing.', 'So um if it wasnt I think um I went through a lot of issues like that with my assistant coach at came for a year and she helped me sort things a lot.', 'She showed that I did have um proper technique.', 'It was more of like like a discriminating issue of my coach wanting certain people on the boat just because he thought it would move better.', 'I realized that um as long as I kept on pursuing the sport like thats all that really mattered.', 'Thats all like my own efforts will fruit in something that will take me somewhere that will help me get into MIT.', 'So I feel like um this this like seeing things in my own way right and being distraught by other people effecting me helped.', 's uh very good.', 'So uh tell me about one of your weaknesses and what youve done to overcome it.', 'I think one of my weaknesses has to be um the fact that Im a little um delinquent with my work.', 'And uh um Im lazy at times.', 'I definitely procrastinate.', 'It was a pursuing thing through high school.', 'And uh its still a little now because of a passing record.', 'One of my combating is goal setting.', 'I learned it from one of my uh from one of these one of an upperclassmen that I know in uh at MIT.', 'He uh told me like to write out like weekly goals and write out long term goals.', 'Like long terms goals meaning like the end of MIT after MIT what you want to do after the MIT experience and short term goals which is like get stuff done now.', 'So in a way that kind of put me things put things in perspective for me.', 'Realize that I shouldnt be burning too much time messing around.', 'By I mean certainly I should be messing around a little bit just because its its a good time to have fun and relax.', 'But at the same time I shouldnt do it in excess.', 'So I guess thats helped me a little bit.', 'd like to have.', 'Might be a rep or something else.', 'Do you have something in mind?', 'Um actually yeah um.', 'Ive never had lab experience before so I really want a role which is why- Uh well for starters um I dont have any experience so I feel like um its a good place for me to start.', 'And Im really willing to do whatever it takes to make time for it.', 'Um I see how um Im not taking too many classes this semester cuz Im a course advantage.', 'Ill be making sure Ill have enough time to make classes uh more manageable.', 'I should be able to commit hours on it.', 'Im really interested in the job Im doing so hopefully that interest will inspire me uh inspire me to work hard.']","[array([0.12264233, 0.00998881, 0.09519747, 0.00211021, 0.7700612 ],

35,35,p53, Um well I was born in Nigeria. Um and I moved to the United States at the age of eight um and lived here um in Boston actually ever since. Um and um for as long as I remember umm Ive always wanted to go into the medical field. Umm Ive always wanted to be a doctor and just recently actually discovered that I wanted to be a pediatrician umm after working with kids and doing a lot of babysitting in high school and have actually umm shadowed a neonatologist and I feel like that was when it clicked that I actually really want to be a pediatrician. Umm and Ive tutored a lot umm middle school and high school and thats really like affirmed the fact that I do like my career. I want it to be something where I work with kids. A time Ive demonstrated leadership. Umm I guess one obvious one is the student groups that I work with. Umm my primary umm student group is the black students union. Im currently a coach here. Umm and Ive been active with the group since Ive been at MIT. Umm currently as a coach here I plan all events for umm the group umm as well as kind of represent the group umm in front of administration as far as like what our members want what they need umm if they have any concerns or anything like that. And we have several meetings with administration on a regular basis just to communicate whats going on what were doing and what our membership needs and what how they can help us with that. Team...faced a challenge. Umm. Okay umm I guess back to the student group. Umm so this is the second time Ive actually been on the executive board. Umm the first umm last year the executive board ran really smoothly. We worked well together but this year we...were kind of having problems cause its a new set of people so its kind of hard adjusting umm to the people Im working with. Umm so you know we all have different viewpoints different ways of approaching things. Umm so we had a lot of loss of communication which kind of hindered umm our uh progress this year umm but in the past few weeks weve been able to kind of figure out that you know theres been a loss of communication and we should definitely like you know we need to figure out how to stop that barrier and learn more to communicate more in order to get the things that we want accomplished done. My weaknesses...umm. I think my biggest weakness is not knowing when to say no. Im the kind of person that if someone asks me to do something even if I feel like its impossible I always say yes. Umm and Ive always...I think I realized that problem when I came at MIT and Ive been working on that ever since my sophomore year umm and Im a junior right now. Umm and what Ive been doing to overcome it is kind of schedule myself. Umm I have my calendar. I live by my calendar and I know if it doesnt fit on my calendar if its overlapping with something then absolutely no I cant do it. So I live by my calendar now and its definitely helping me say no to things when people ask me to do things for them.[??] medical school? [laughs] Umm. I think that I am a good asset.

It was originally aimed for just ya know local umm Boston girls so we did all the publicizing for that I mean I know get it a lot more publicity than we expected people in from like California and stuff so. Yup. Okay umm so I guess Im also a member of China Development Initiative and so a lot of times umm when were in events most of them are within our own group so were brainstorming for like service leadership programs and stuff like that. But umm we also try to do some events where we bring in professors and other speakers. So some of the big challenges we face include umm actually finding these speakers getting them to really correspond with us. Like sometimes theyll respond and be like oh were interested but then they just dont follow up so going after them kinda looking for that response. okay umm I would say Im generally more of a passive person when someone gives me a task Ill do it I wont really like if i get stuck Ill kind of try to keep working on it myself instead of asking for help. Umm so Ive been trying to umm i guess talk to more higher ups if i run into issues or ask more questions i guess. Umm we being? Okay.

37,37,p56, Um well my names Ann. Im currently a Junior in [??] Biology. Im originally from San Francisco. Um I am interested in going to medical school. And I didnt really come to this decision until like around Au- August or September of this year. I was deciding like I mean I always had it like in the back of my mind . . .-hmm. . . . cuz my dad is a doctor.-hmm. Um but and I knew coming into college I wanted to study Biology. I wasnt sure if I wanted to do um like research or um medical school. So um I had a year off or I still have a year off. And of course [??] and I really liked it. But I felt like research is something uh you have to be like self driven . . .. . . . to do. And I kept getting like frustrated because a lot of my experiments they wouldnt work and I felt really bad. [??] And then uh I also like volunteer at a hospital just to like gain experience and see what its like. And uh I enjoy helping people. So I think decided for sure now [??] school. Um I guess leadership can be like defined in a lot of ways I guess. One of my main activities that Ive been doing at [??] is um working in a student group called ESP or the Educational Studies Program. And um so I teach an AP biology class on the weekends to the high school students in the area. And I guess thats kind of like being a leader because you have to like stay in control of the class and organize everything.-hmm. Tell me about a time you were working on a team and face a challenge. How did you solve that problem? Um I guess um the experience thats like most like strongest in my mind is actually from high school.-hmm. So I used to be on uh my high schools robotics team. And uh none of us really like knew much about engineering or like building robots when we first started.-hmm. So it required a lot of like teamwork and working together. Um I remember communication was one of our main issues because we would divide into sub-teams and then each sub-team would like work on a part of the robot. -hmm. But then sometimes we forgot to like communicate clearly with each other and then that result in major problems down the road. So . . . Um so I guess for us it was like a spe- special situation because um um we were all like my friends and I were all sophomores.-hmm. And then there were no upperclassmen above us . . .-hmm. . . . on our robotics team. So our like very first years that we were the leaders of our team we really struggled because we didnt we had no like prior experience . . . . . . in how to organize a team. So like after our first year like our sophomore year together we like like had a like a sit down discussion afterwards . . .  . . . and like talked about what went wrong like what couldve been better. So the next year we we have like uh we implemented like uh daily meetings. So like before we would like split up for the day and like work on our uh work on our robot. We would like outline a plan and then like show it to everyone . . . -hmm. . . . and like discuss with everyone. So that really helped. they discuss Um one of my weaknesses is Im really shy. Like I think when I was younger I go- I didnt like to like talk to strangers . . .-hmm. . . . or talk in in front of a large group of people. So um when I came to college I thought that uh I should try to improve that. So um I think the main thing I tried to do was the teaching activity I talked about before. Um requires me to you know stand in front of a group of high school students and talk for like three hours at a time. So I think uh Im becoming a lot more comfortable like talking in front of people I dont really know that well.-hmm thats great. Um why do you think you should get into medical school? Um I think I have like the passion to help people. Um I I had a lot of like volunteer activities but I really enjoy helping people especially like um children.-hmm. So I used to I used to tutor like young children at the Cambridge Community Center and teach them how to read. Um and Im currently doing the like tutoring I mean not tutoring the AP [??] teaching. You know um so Im like motivated to help people. Um and I think that like as especially as the world becomes like bigger or the population gets greater more and more people like will need medical help. So I think being a doctor would be a good good way to help people. ,"[' Um well my names Ann.', 'Im currently a Junior in [??]', 'Biology.', 'Im originally from San Francisco.', 'Um I am interested in going to medical school.', 'And I didnt really come to this decision until like around Au- August or September of this year.', 'I was deciding like I mean I always had it like in the back of my mind .', '.', '.-hmm.', '.', '.', '.', 'cuz my dad is a doctor.-hmm.', 'Um but and I knew coming into college I wanted to study Biology.', 'I wasnt sure if I wanted to do um like research or um medical school.', 'So um I had a year off or I still have a year off.', 'And of course [??]', 'and I really liked it.', 'But I felt like research is something uh you have to be like self driven .', '.', '.. .', '.', '.', 'to do.', 'And I kept getting like frustrated because a lot of my experiments they wouldnt work and I felt really bad.', '[??]', 'And then uh I also like volunteer at a hospital just to like gain experience and see what its like.', 'And uh I enjoy helping people.', 'So I think decided for sure now [??]', 'school.', 'Um I guess leadership can be like defined in a lot of ways I guess.', 'One of my main activities that Ive been doing at [??]', 'is um working in a student group called ESP or the Educational Studies Program.', 'And um so I teach an AP biology class on the weekends to the high school students in the area.', 'And I guess thats kind of like being a leader because you have to like stay in control of the class and organize everything.-hmm.', 'Tell me about a time you were working on a team and face a challenge.', 'How did you solve that problem?', 'Um I guess um the experience thats like most like strongest in my mind is actually from high school.-hmm.', 'So I used to be on uh my high schools robotics team.', 'And uh none of us really like knew much about engineering or like building robots when we first started.-hmm.', 'So it required a lot of like teamwork and working together.', 'Um I remember communication was one of our main issues because we would divide into sub-teams and then each sub-team would like work on a part of the robot.', '-hmm.', 'But then sometimes we forgot to like communicate clearly with each other and then that result in major problems down the road.', 'So .', '.', '.', 'Um so I guess for us it was like a spe- special situation because um um we were all like my friends and I were all sophomores.-hmm.', 'And then there were no upperclassmen above us .', '.', '.-hmm.', '.', '.', '.', 'on our robotics team.', 'So our like very first years that we were the leaders of our team we really struggled because we didnt we had no like prior experience .', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'in how to organize a team.', 'So like after our first year like our sophomore year together we like like had a like a sit down discussion afterwards .', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'and like talked about what went wrong like what couldve been better.', 'So the next year we we have like uh we implemented like uh daily meetings.', 'So like before we would like split up for the day and like work on our uh work on our robot.', 'We would like outline a plan and then like show it to everyone .', '.', '.', '-hmm.', '.', '.', '.', 'and like discuss with everyone.', 'So that really helped.', 'they discuss Um one of my weaknesses is Im really shy.', 'Like I think when I was younger I go- I didnt like to like talk to strangers .', '.', '.-hmm.', '.', '.', '.', 'or talk in in front of a large group of people.', 'So um when I came to college I thought that uh I should try to improve that.', 'So um I think the main thing I tried to do was the teaching activity I talked about before.', 'Um requires me to you know stand in front of a group of high school students and talk for like three hours at a time.', 'So I think uh Im becoming a lot more comfortable like talking in front of people I dont really know that well.-hmm thats great.', 'Um why do you think you should get into medical school?', 'Um I think I have like the passion to help people.', 'Um I I had a lot of like volunteer activities but I really enjoy helping people especially like um children.-hmm.', 'So I used to I used to tutor like young children at the Cambridge Community Center and teach them how to read.', 'Um and Im currently doing the like tutoring I mean not tutoring the AP [??]', 'teaching.', 'You know um so Im like motivated to help people.', 'Um and I think that like as especially as the world becomes like bigger or the population gets greater more and more people like will need medical help.', 'So I think being a doctor would be a good good way to help people.']","[array([0.68069416, 0.02019295, 0.02243132, 0.00254285, 0.27413866],

38,38,p57, Im doing very well thanks. How are you? Im currently a junior pursuing a degree in both computer science and business and whats really drawn me to both of these is the fact that they involve a lot of problem solving and a lot of interpersonal dynamics. A lot of interesting questions come up where its a lot of actually thinking innovatively and thats why Ive chose to major in both of these and actually thats why Im interesting in consulting is because its a good application of the problem solving that Im doing in both of those.ve demonstrated leadership. Umm recently I was in a group project where each of us kind of had our own task to do and it was a very straightforward class project however umm these was I noticed a lack of communication a lack of set deadlines so umm in that case I kind of stepped up. I organized communication between all of us. I really got us on the same page and pushed us to a strict deadline and you know its a good thing I started when I did because otherwise we would have missed the deadline. Umm Ive also had a lot of leadership positions if you want something a little bit more structured.Uh huh.Would you like me to tell you about one of those?d be great. Okay. Umm last semester I was an event director for my sorority and what I had to do for that the biggest event especially logistically fell under my responsibilities so I with a $2 200 budget organized a dinner event for 200 people at restaurants across Boston so this involved umm finding places making all food allergies were taken care of really finding out what everyone in my sorority needed and wanted with their evening and this also involved a lot of delegation because you know there were about 20 restaurants involved and I couldnt personally be in charge of all of those so I had to delegate out to a committee make sure that they knew what was happening manage the risk aspect of it by keeping track of who had left who hadnt gone as yet everyone knew their reservations how to get there how to get back. So in that case it was kind of a different style of leadership with more of delegation and things like that. Umm let me see. I guess the first thing that comes to mind is that same item I was just talking about where we werent all on the same page and not communicating.Mmm. Uh huh.Umm I can also try to think of something else if you dont mind giving me just a minute. Umm so I guess in one of my classes last year we had a team project where certain elements of it were things that none of three of us on the team knew how to do or were particularly interested in learning how umm and the way we kind of resolved that issue because clearly as an aspect it needed to get done we resolved that by making sure the person who took that had less responsibilities elsewhere to kind of balance it out. So the girl who took that was happy because her main priority was spending less time whereas for the rest of us we were more interested in the actual material so we found a mutually agreeable solution.…Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what youre doing to overcome it? Yes. Umm I think one of my weaknesses is that I tend to get very excited about everything Im doing you know that like Im a double major because I started in computer science and then I went oh management really excites me too I want to do that as well which in the past has led me to kind of overextend myself a little bit which as a result when youre really excited about everything but then you try to do everything the amount of commitment you give to each one is reducing but Im conscious of this year. I cut down a little bit on my extracurriculars and…especially because last year while doing all of those I wasnt sleeping as much which you know while I was still there and pulling my share and everything you know it was harder to be a full present member of anything if youre tired. So this year I kind of focused in on the things that were most important to me and Im aware of that so when I feel myself reaching my limit Ill actually try to prioritize more. As I mentioned before what Im studying in school is very applicable to consulting but in addition to that Im really excited about the work that consultants do especially as I mentioned Im very interested in a wide range of fields and with you consulting you really get to explore a lot of those delve into them and in consulting Id get to apply my favorite aspects of computer science and management both which is again the problem solving the thinking innovatively. These are all things that are very important to a consulting company and that is exactly what I love to do so I think I would have that passion and drive that makes every member of your company that Ive spoken to really engaging and it seems from all of my previous conversations with them that theyre really excited about this which is you know exactly what I would hope to bring as well.,"[' Im

and actually thats why Im interesting in consulting is because its a good application of the problem solving that Im doing in both of those.ve demonstrated leadership.', 'Umm recently I was in a group project where each of us kind of had our own task to do and it was a very straightforward class project however umm these was I noticed a lack of communication a lack of set deadlines so umm in that case I kind of stepped up.', 'I organized communication between all of us.', 'I really got us on the same page and pushed us to a strict deadline and you know its a good thing I started when I did because otherwise we would have missed the deadline.', 'Umm Ive also had a lot of leadership positions if you want something a little bit more structured.Uh huh.Would you like me to tell you about one of those?d be great.', 'Okay.', 'Umm last semester I was an event director for my sorority and what I had to do for that the biggest event especially logistically fell under my responsibilities so I with a $2 200 budget organized a dinner event for 200 people at restaurants across Boston so this involved umm finding places making all food allergies were taken care of really finding out what everyone in my sorority needed and wanted with their evening and this also involved a lot of delegation because you know there were about 20 restaurants involved and I couldnt personally be in charge of all of those so I had to delegate out to a committee make sure that they knew what was happening manage the risk aspect of it by keeping track of who had left who hadnt gone as yet everyone knew their reservations how to get there how to get back.', 'So in that case it was kind of a different style of leadership with more of delegation and things like that.', 'Umm let me see.', 'I guess the first thing that comes to mind is that same item I was just talking about where we werent all on the same page and not communicating.Mmm.', 'Uh huh.Umm I can also try to think of something else if you dont mind giving me just a minute.', 'Umm so I guess in one of my classes last year we had a team project where certain elements of it were things that none of three of us on the team knew how to do or were particularly interested in learning how umm and the way we kind of resolved that issue because clearly as an aspect it needed to get done we resolved that by making sure the person who took that had less responsibilities elsewhere to kind of balance it out.', 'So the girl who took that was happy because her main priority was spending less time whereas for the rest of us we were more interested in the actual material so we found a mutually agreeable solution.…Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what youre doing to overcome it?', 'Yes.', 'Umm I think one of my weaknesses is that I tend to get very excited about everything Im doing you know that like Im a double major because I started in computer science and then I went oh management really excites me too I want to do that as well which in the past has led me to kind of overextend myself a little bit which as a result when youre really excited about everything but then you try to do everything the amount of commitment you give to each one is reducing but Im conscious of this year.', 'I cut down a little bit on my extracurriculars and…especially because last year while doing all of those I wasnt sleeping as much which you know while I was still there and pulling my share and everything you know it was harder to be a full present member of anything if youre tired.', 'So this year I kind of focused in on the things that were most important to me and Im aware of that so when I feel myself reaching my limit Ill actually try to prioritize more.', 'As I mentioned before what Im studying in school is very applicable to consulting but in addition to that Im really excited about the work that consultants do especially as I mentioned Im very interested in a wide range of fields and with you consulting you really get to explore a lot of those delve into them and in consulting Id get to apply my favorite aspects of computer science and management both which is again the problem solving the thinking innovatively.', 'These are all things that are very important to a consulting company and that is exactly what I love to do so I think I would have that passion and drive that makes every member of your company that Ive spoken to really engaging and it seems from all of my previous conversations with them that theyre really excited about this which is you know exactly what I would hope to bring as well.']","[array([0.6423337 , 0.0062318 , 0.20705672, 0.01628011, 0.12809768],

39,39,p58, Good. Im a junior at MIT studying Ocean Engineering. And Im really interested in working with big ships. I love being on boats and by the water. I am on the sailing team. I spent the summer building underwater robots. Um this last year um I restarted the section of the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers at MIT. We had one about five years ago when Ocean Engineering was Course 13 but now its merged with the Mechanical Engineering Department and when that happened the organization fell apart. But I knew that me and some of the other Ocean Engineers wanted to really have our own society. So I started it and I went to this meeting to how to get it all setup and got a professor to sponsor us. Mmhmm This last January I was working with my team in robotics team. And we there was a big conflict in the team because we thought we were going to build a six foot long glider which is pretty huge. The parts are so large and so heavy we couldnt machine anything ourselves we had to get it all done in a machine shop externally. But we had to have a glider that size to like accomplish the goals for the glider which were look for oil. Um so like but then were were also working on a smaller version of the glider that didnt have all the sensors we needed but otherwise had the same capabilities. And it was more easier and more fun because we could machine everything. And um it was easier to understand the small piece. But there was an awkward moment in January when half the team was working on the big glider and half the team was working on the small glider and we didnt know if we wanted to trash the big glider and work on the small one. And so I was part of the team that decided that we should focus on the small glider. So we took the design from the big glider and took as much as we could to put on the small glider and assigned people to work on the small glider. One of my weaknesses is I think being aware of the energy that I bring into a room. So when I am at meetings I really try to put positive energy into the room. Even if one day Im really feeling quiet I make an effort to say things or make an effort to react to say things. Haha You should hire me because um I can bring good energy to a team and engineering experience especially related to the ocean and ships related to the ocean and underwater vehicles. And I have experience working on teams.,"[' Good.', 'Im a junior at MIT studying Ocean Engineering.', 'And Im really interested in working with big ships.', 'I love being on boats and by the water.', 'I am on the sailing team.', 'I spent the summer building underwater robots.', 'Um this last year um I restarted the section of the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers at MIT.', 'We had one about five years ago when Ocean Engineering was Course 13 but now its merged with the Mechanical Engineering Department and when that happened the organization fell apart.', 'But I knew that me and some of the other Ocean Engineers wanted to really have our own society.', 'So I started it and I went to this meeting to how to get it all setup and got a professor to sponsor us.', 'Mmhmm This last January I was working with my team in robotics team.', 'And we there was a big conflict in the team because we thought we were going to build a six foot long glider which is pretty huge.', 'The parts are so large and so heavy we couldnt machine anything ourselves we had to get it all done in a machine shop externally.', 'But we had to have a glider that size to like accomplish the goals for the glider which were look for oil.', 'Um so like but then were were also working on a smaller version of the glider that didnt have all the sensors we needed but otherwise had the same capabilities.', 'And it was more easier and more fun because we could machine everything.', 'And um it was easier to understand the small piece.', 'But there was an awkward moment in January when half the team was working on the big glider and half the team was working on the small glider and we didnt know if we wanted to trash the big glider and work on the small one.', 'And so I was part of the team that decided that we should focus on the small glider.', 'So we took the design from the big glider and took as much as we could to put on the small glider and assigned people to work on the small glider.', 'One of my weaknesses is I think being aware of the energy that I bring into a room.', 'So when I am at meetings I really try to put positive energy into the room.', 'Even if one day Im really feeling quiet I make an effort to say things or make an effort to react to say things.', 'Haha You should hire me because um I can bring good energy to a team and engineering experience especially related to the ocean and ships related to the ocean and underwater vehicles.', 'And I have experience working on teams.']","[array([2.5457432e-02, 1.0670138e-03, 1.0337941e-03, 8.8544219e-04,

41,41,p6, Im doing good. How are you?Thank you. Well um my name is Jeff um. I was born in Japan. I lived there for seven years before I moved to the uh US. First to Michigan for two years and then to Maryland. Um and it was when I was in high school or Im sorry middle school that I was exposed to um a lot of different math uh science advanced science courses. Um it was where um I was exposed to a lot of um math competitions and computer science competitions. And it was around my uh junior year in high school. It was around my junior year in school because of peer and parental pressures I decided to do pre-med. I decided to pursue uh a career in medicine. Um so it was in high school that I decided start taking biology classes physics physiology and um when I got here to MIT I decided to major in Course 20. Um and after about four lab positions two of the (inaudible) and two of chemistry that I realized um the Course 20 the medicine track wasnt for me. Um mainly because it wasnt quantitative enough or competitive enough or fast paced enough for me. But with my last internship in the biotech industry I had the privilege of talking to talk with several site directors. Um it was because of and through that meeting I realized that I might really like finance and that it might be more suitable for me. Um and afterwards I started talking to some colleagues. Um some finance majors. And thats why Im here. Um I would say it was during high school. There was this one group sophomore year. We had to do this mission this project called Mission Impossible where we had to design a rover that would uh traverse a uh a uh platform with quantum data. The problem with the group was there was supposed to be a leader but nobody really took an responsibility to do what they had to do. That was partly due to the fact that nobody really individuals were assigned anything. So that was when I had to I decided to take the initiative a couple of days before it was due. Actually with the whole project to uh become the leader. The unofficial itself leader. As a leader I uh assigned a tasks to people. Politely I asked them to do this because this was a very um (coughs) multi- prospective project that um. It required programming construction and educating. And yeah I decided to be leader and assign tasks. And I would say it was pretty successful the robot got in time it was due. Ok well I would like to talk about my past at my most recent internship at a biotech company. Um and the problem was that I was working as an individual group. It was because I was working with cells. And cells the way cells work is that um that you culture them like on say day 1. And you let them grow like four or five or six and then you let them grow until you collect data. And the problem is youre not even cant collect the data on day one you have to collect on day six. And if anything happens on day 3 or day four or something or sometime between day one and day five the data will make no sense. You would have to re-start the experiment. And I was on a tight schedule and this was a ten week project. And in the first two weeks I contaminated the cells. Um both weeks um. And so my data had to be re-done my experiment had to be re-done. The problem was that this was a ten week project and I had eight weeks to do. One thing I learned about internships is to not panic when situations like such as this arise. And uh what I did was I went to people for help. Um and I definitely spent more hours. I talked to the HR department I talked to my managers to increase my hours from 40 to 60 hours. Uh so instead I went Saturdays and Sundays too. In fact there was this one point where I worked 23 days in a row um. And uh successfully I think finished it. In fact after my data analysis and data compiling uh I presented my data to the site director. He told me I had the most impressive presentation out of all the 21 other interns there. Um So Yeah it was during challenges like that because of challenges like that that Ive learned to not panic in a stressful situation and to definitely branch out for help. I think one of my weaknesses is that I dont have a formal education in finance. Um I decided to be Course 20 and um uh and I decided to pursue pre-med. And I was I agree uh that it was a very sudden transition to math Course 18. I think make up for that at least partially by uh going to workshops uh going to reading books um. I definitely have been networking with colleagues. So in terms of the financial models uh the mental math skills and the preliminary skills that I mean to I believe I have a very strong grasp of those. Well I think um that compared to the rest of the competition no one shows more initiative than I do. And in fact I dont anyone has the technical skills or the willingness to work such long hours. Um I think one of my strengths is that I dont have any problems with high expectations because I had to do such a sudden transition in career. I had to do a lot research to convince myself that I wont have to do this transition again. Like I said Ive networked Ive done tons of research Ive read books Ive done tons and tons of research. And you know out to site directors you know even out to first year analysts. And I know exactly what my job is. And I know that the long hours are tough and anyone else who says they like the long hours would be lying to you. And I know the exact skill sets required and I believe I have those skill sets. Thank you. Thank you for this opportunity. ,"[' Im doing good.', 'How are you?Thank you.', 'Well um my name is Jeff um.', 'I was born in Japan.', 'I lived there for seven years before I moved to the uh US.',

42,42,p60,Interveiwee: Good how are you? So umm Im from Chicago... and Im a junior here at MIT umm when I came here I was pretty sure I wanted to do health related work so I guess I came in as a biology major. And my dad is also a MDHP really interested - or really involved in research Um and so sort of that influenced me a lot. So then I realized after doing biology for two years essentially that I wasnt really enjoying it (laughs). And so I decided to try out computer science. Because this is MIT after all and if I did want to do biology in the future which its not that I dont like biology its that I didnt feel like I was learning skills that would contribute to the field I guess. And so um yeah. So then I decided to do computer science. Thats a very small part of me (laughs). Thats a very broad question. Um so I am the co-president of an organization at MIT called Glo-Met and what we do is were partnered with a non-profit gratitude organization abroad so our group is basically non profit. We work with HIV health care work in Togo and so I guess an example of leadership would be this whole semester I suppose its been a work in progress its the first time Ive ever been like in a presidents role in a group of about 30 people. And all the records are new this year its a new organization. So its sort of like realizing you know theres so many aspects of leadership its not just like not only the objectives your group needs to get done but also the camaraderie you have in a group and we can show thats being maintained properly. Um and we had a lot of really troublesome leadership experiences last year with this group. Um so I guess Ive been learning a lot. Do you have specific questions about that? Okay. So yea in terms of like leading a group of people that are like you know my age umm and were all like new at it its definitely a work in progress. But we do a number of things in terms of umm we fund raise for... so we hold campaigns and we fund raise in order to basically fund our projects abroad in Togo so we are trying.. our main project right now is to improve the technological efficiencies of the clinic that were partnered with in Togo so we... its hard sometimes motivating a group of people when your partner is abroad its not like we havent met them yet and its a new partnership so were traveling there this summer but since its new its kind of as a leader I think it takes a lot of like not only vision and fore planning but like also like you have to be able to step back and allow other leaders in your group to step up. You cant just do everything yourself. Even if that seems easier. Umm and then also like maintaining the motivation among a group of people that are like really busy with other things in their lives. So thats the biggest challenge I think but. Umm... so I guess the same organization we had a lot of umm problems. Um so we are a team as an organization. So last year I was like a director on the exec board but not umm one of the co-presidents and the biggest challenge weve had as a team was that our co presidents were not motivated had very poor communication and we didnt have we just didnt really get anything done. Umm so a challenge on my part was not really I wasnt sure I knew what needed to get done and I knew things like we needed to be more efficient and take more initiative and you know motivate our staff because its not like its not just about us we obviously there are people that like depend on us.. and umm the problem was like not stepping on their toes at the same time while trying to.. trying to get them motivated but you know telling and I think a challenge was that they felt it was they felt personally attacked when people criticize them. Or when people try to make suggestions for better things to do umm so I think solving that problem was more just stepping back and being like you cant do everything if that person is the president you just have to let them do what theyre gonna do and wait til your ends do your job right but dont try to push like you cant always push through things sometimes you gotta just like go. And like... and I guess thats... that did kind of solve the problem. I mean I didnt solve the problem of like things not getting done. But like I think realizing that actually helps a lot. Because it was just like banging your head against the wall. So.. yeah! (Laughs) Thats like also a weakness I guess.. I guess a weakness of mine would be that I am pretty umm.. Knowing how to step back and not umm.. basically not trying to do everything myself when its definitely supposed to be a team effort and that involves a lot of like trust in other people and their competency. So umm... definitely giving people the chance to do the job right. And sometimes you make second chances. So I think thats.. I might have a bad temper sometimes. That can be part of it (laughs). So yeah. I think because Im very motivated. And I have a lot of self initiative and Im hard on myself so that sometimes I expect highly of other people in the same way and that can I mean that is part of both the challenge and the weakness question that youve asked about but I think that is umm good in when you have a team of people and like you need somebody that umm is very meticulous about delegating things properly and making sure things are done at the right time. And somebody who really takes like self responsibility for things. So.. I think if its for like a project for example like a small group project its like good to have someone that isnt shy to speak up in a group. And somebody that can sort of like organize the group to to coordinate the group better. Like vocally.

They spoke both English and Chinese so I would say that Im pretty you know fluent at both languages. And yeah really look to both California and Taiwan as my homes. Ok umm lets see… So I as I said Im from Taiwan and Im Im part of a student group here at MIT called the association of Taiwanese students and what I actually was was a cultural chair uh for a year and one of our main events is to create a night market so umm yeah so instead of you know the outdoors night markets that you see in cities in Asia uhh we actually took it inside into our student center so we had to work with umm the leadership from a bunch of different other clubs so this included like the Chinese students club umm the association of sorry the Asian American Association as well some other umm cultural clubs in order to create this event and so what my partner and I were in charge of was the food and what we thought we thought that this was you know one of the umm biggest points of the event in the first place so umm yeah I think that you know ha… getting everyone umm as a group to really sit down and look at you know how much money we had to allocate here and how much umm you know time everybody needed to set up umm and we yeah so my partner and I were in charge of that and I thought that that was one time where we really showed our leadership and made something umm you know arise out of that. A team umm lets see ok so over the summer umm I actually this last summer before my junior year umm I went to Taiwan and China. Taiwan and Hong Kong specifically to teach… And this was in groups of three so there were two other MIT students and I umm teaching in a group… And so what this conflict arose umm where we had two weeks of umm teaching and we werent sure because there were there was also another group another group of three teaching at the same time and we werent sure if the students really wanted us to like switch classes so that they could get umm more more time with all of the six instructors umm or if we just wanted to stick with the same grup of students for a complete two weeks… And so you know kind of a conflict arose out of that umm it was pretty much you know three versus three like three of us wanted we thought that it would be a good idea to switch and umm the other three thought that you know they wanted to have a more personal relationship with their students. And umm yeah eventually what you know we we sat down at first it was pretty heated umm like so two of uhh my colleagues like one person from my team and someone from the other umm had you know really strong strong ideas about umm what they wanted to do. So you know what I said was hey everybody like lets sit down and calm down and you know think this through and talk it through and you know I I felt like I was one of the mediators in that you know I didnt let myself get you know too involved at first and I didnt let you know start screaming or anything like that and I was really the one that said hey everybody sit down umm lets talk this through and so we really just you know calmly and logically thought it through talked it through and you know we were like oh what would be the advantages of of switching and what would be the disadvantages? And in the end we felt like umm the students were there to get breath and not necessarily depth Since it was only two weeks anyway and so we felt like it would be a lot better for them to umm have more exposure to all of the MIT instructors from all different backgrounds.re doing to overcome it? Ok. I feel like one of my greatest weaknesses is uhh self confidence. I you know Im not naturally somebody who really wants to take a center stage to everything Umm and you know there are people like some of my friends are very much so people who are in the center of attention a lot. And I think that thats something that I have been working on and will strive to work on umm in the future as well. Well I think that you know I (laughs) I Ive demonstrated a lot of umm I have a lot of experience in the medical field umm as a college student umm I do research in as I said in the hematology lab and I actually also work as an EMT. So thats been a very very large big part of my life since umm last January.

45,45,p63, Pretty good how are you? All right. Um I guess to start with the basics Im uh a junior at MIT right now. Im studying course six three its computer science. And uh I guess I didnt really get into computer science until last year. And um thats after I transferred here from the University of Michigan. And then uh since then pretty much everything I do has been computer science. Yeah. All right um so this past um this past summer um I uh got well I guess last year I got involved with an organization on campus called Camp Kasim.-hmm. And so Camp Kasim runs a camp for the children of cancer patients. And its um its kind of a therapeutic camp so the aim is for kids to just have fun. And anyway we have various units that we break the kids up into to that are divided up by age. And um I wasnt the unit leader for my unit but uh there was a time when our unit leader had to go off and uh it was either his break or he had to uh go off and take care of some other stuff. And so uh I was kind of given control of the unit. And so um it was an interesting experience because we were dealing with kids. But um obviously the counselors were adults and college students my peers.So um theres this kind of flip flopping between interacting with my peers and like making sure they were on top of their um you know their jobs as counselors. Watching the kids and making sure the kids are having fun. Also like playing around with the kids and making sure the kids are like not thinking about anything but having but having a good time. So um this kind of I just like should that answer the question? All right um so in I guess the last time I can really remember being part of uh really intense team experience was um in high school I was on the year book as a photographer. So um we I my friend and I were both the head photographers. So we organized all the photos. And so we would coordinate with the editors. And um in that they would tell us what sort of content we needed like what events needed to have photos taken of them or what teams needed photos. And we would go about organizing the actual um like the sending of the photographers to go to these events or to get the team photos. And so um there we times when like just getting making sure that our photographers got to events uh and like and end up getting a decent amount of good photos um was could be very challenging. Because I mean because we were all very busy students. And so um one like just I guess one challenge we faced was just getting people to like really commit to their job and follow through on that. And so part of what we did was just try to build a really strong like team culture. And a sense of like comradery among the photographers themselves. Um you know try to get people to um like try to get people to go to event even though and they werent assigned. Just out of like the eagerness to take photos and photography. And so um we kind of approached this challenge and motivated it was like it was sort of a challenge in motivating our our um peers. And so um or like incentivizing these photos. And we approached by trying to like build a sense of community and uh like like and like and ambition in terms of like taking photos. Um it was it ended up playing out very well but theres still a couple photographers who just you know. They just didnt want to do the job sometimes. I mean they they usually had like valid some what valid excuses but. Yeah but yeah this job still need to get done. So uh yeah I mean that was uh pretty interesting team experience. Sure um yes. Lets see um maybe one of my Id say one of my weaknesses is communicating my thoughts clearly. Uh at times I struggle to uh I struggle to quickly come up with a sentence or phrase to describe what Im thinking. And so I like I find myself kind of slowly articulating a sentence. And um theres some situations were just like that those pauses and that slow thinking or slow articulation is uh can be problematic. And in other in other situations like the slow thinking ends up being some what useful because Ive you know I dont say anything I dont tend to say anything rash. And so um it has its merits. But usually its just in general its nicer just to have a faster pace so in kind of like conveying thoughts. Um um so Id say that Im committed hard working uh person. And in terms of this job I guess uh and my edge can I describe what it is? All right so in my head its a software engineering position and so I believe as um I can contribute a lot to this with the skills that Ive gained here at uh MIT. And then also I believe that I can gain a lot from the company in terms of learning um about what they do and how they do it. And I think it would be a good partnership. ,"[' Pretty good how are you?', 'All right.', 'Um I guess to start with the basics Im uh a junior at MIT right now.', 'Im studying course six three its

46,46,p64, So umm I was wandering umm Im actually from Russia. I grew up in Tulun though and I normally go to Cambridge University- -which is which is where I study. Here I am uhh a foreign exchange student uhh with MIT. Uhh I study course six umm mainly I focus my interest split them more like uhh between umm the afternoon where I focus more on devices look like nano electronics uhh processing methods umm circuits and also stuff that has to do with uhh I think it has to do with AI control machine loading umm so what Im interested in. Ive been taking courses to that uhh goal so things like 6034 6052 6017 umm in those same areas Ive done several projects umm like something Cambridge over summer I did a I wrote a uhh simulator umm the simulator basically simulates a landing on Mars and has to take in account physics umm graphics planetary rotation umm and I have to write an AI which accounts for all that and is able to land and launch umm in a space craft. Umm similarly Ive also been participating in a robotics uhh competition in Cambridge. Umm it was similar to MITs Mass Lab umm and I was on the software team again uhh although I have done a little bit of electronics and the goal of that project was to in a team of six create a robot which is able to navigate a black uh sorry a white grid on a black table umm and be able to pick up a cylinder thing with a magnet or without a magnet based on whether uhh it was magnetic or not take it into a certain box and I programmed the uh AI for that. So thats the most experience Ive had. Umm in Cambridge here uhh Ive considered participating in uhh umm Battlecode or Mass Lab perhaps. Umm theres been some quite interesting projects going on umm in class; those should be quite interesting. Yeah yeah it was good pretty good. Umm so umm again in the robotics project uhh competition at Cambridge umm in in our team of six I had to in some ways help out and direct the design choices in our umm for the competition. Uhh some things include deciding which sensors to be placed and where and kind of the overall idea was basically because I am running the AI I have to umm have a clear idea of what the robot has to do what its components are and I was the one to be the go-to guy in case somebody had to make the decision up based on that. And I made decisions uhh just based on rationality where umm if something was the idea was that something has to be umm only as complicated as it needs to be and no more complicated because any more complications make problems stuff doesnt work breaks umm so yeah. And I also helped out with the electronics and sometimes the woodshure which umm sensors to hook up to which control lines and stuff like that and I had to blast them on umm well what I wanted to be done for the AI to work properly. Umm another case of leadership I guess was I did military service in Finland uh uhh as a citizen- -and umm so we had this at the end of the service near to the end there was a umm a anti air camp where all the anti air regiments and battalions were coming together at this one big training camp and as a member of the communication squad umm we had to go and set up some things for the light fly exercises and because our sergeant was away doing some things umm I really didnt know what he was doing but I-I had to take charge of the squad and make sure that the cables were done right and had to delegate tasks to certain people that you know these two guys you know do this cable and these guys set up the radio Ill do this and so yeah it was quite alright I guess that way. Umm well with the with the six people uhh we split each ourselves in three teams three sub teams. One was mechanical one was electrical and one was uhh AI. Now because my programming experience was much bigger than the programming experience of the other guy on my team umm we said that itd be better if he was to help out with the mechanics cause there was umm a lot of hand work to be done uhh a lot of design work there and the AI is easily written by me when umm I just kind of have a clear idea it was much faster then splitting with other people it was rather simple AI I guess. Umm now with the mechanics its much more important they get all this stuff done leave some time in the workshop work so it was a decision we had to make umm to get more of that kind of get more of that hand work to the mechanical team more man power to the mechanical team. Uhh with the electrical team umm we decided that we wanted the meaning doing most of the design work for the electronics cause you get a better idea and they also gonna be doing most of the soldering of electronic parts cause so we got uhh some basic components we we got this controller block umm with with a CPU inside but it had to be wired to sensors and controllers and other controllers and all that so we had to do all those circuits. Umm so one of the guys Oscar umm was much more into that so he took charge into design and uhh Calvin did much more the soldering and stuff. I kind of helped out when they needed some help. Umm so yeah we just needed to have a clear delegation of tasks and just do a bit of try if somebody needs something done wed be able to produce a kind of working-ish result- -so that we could get stuff out. So as an example I-I made a control system which uhh follows the lines way before I wrote any of the code for picking up stuff or testing what it is and how to choose where it goes. The idea was that I am able to follow the line and turn umm which kind of tricky actually so the way the sensors set up and the motors werent properly balanced and such. Umm so the mechanic guys managed to work together umm at a quick rate with just some of the basic plates they didnt they didnt cut them or anything. They just got a plate put some motors on uhh hooked up the motors into the CPU and did that and it worked. I was able to make the AI which follows the lines which was pretty good. Umm also that that that did mean that the umm the Oscar who made the sensor connectors umm he had to kind of work faster and make those particular circuits work before he made any other control circuits. But delegating those things that way it well will do a step by step and do it gradually. Umm I guess one of my weaknesses is that I often get carried away umm I guess somewhat arrogantly. Umm when Im working with something and I think I have a really good idea of what I am doing umm something is better than other umm I have a better idea of wondering than therefore try to tell them maybe theyre doing it slightly wrong be sort of somewhat more self-absorbed in what resources need to be allocated because Im doing a lot of stuff and they might be doing it more slowly so I can use this for longer or something. Umm not not to the point of insulting people but more sort of center of attention kind thing I guess. Umm Im trying to kind of be more mindful of what other people are doing and sometimes that even though I think I have an idea of what Im doing I dont actually or that I might be mistaken. So I kind of try to be more kind of chilled and laid back just yeah so yeah but its a work in progress. Umm well you should hire me because I am capable of uhh pretty good verbal communication umm I dont really stress out much I think so Im quite relaxed that way. Im able to speak three languages so Im able to communicate quite well umm Norwich Finnish and English. Umm and I tend to be quite good at being able to delegate tasks to people so Id be good for like a project lead I guess because I have a pretty good technical background and I understand the tech and I quite enjoy working with the tech and I also like being with a team environment where I can delegate tasks and work on umm different things. On on some things we can accomplish by ourselves on a larger project working on a team is quite fun if it works out right.,"[' So umm I was wandering umm Im actually from Russia.', 'I grew up in Tulun

47,47,p65, Yeah pretty good. Um dont feel particularly different from any other day.[laughs] Uh so please tell me about yourself. Um so Im from Nearbell Fosten [SP] Northern Ireland. I have three younger brothers um so I think they have kind of influenced me as much as I probably have influenced them. Like Mark the next one down hes only a year younger than me so he was always a lot sportier. Uh coming up through school he was always playing rugby and cricket and because of that I got into those sports. Um and then Ian the next one down after him is a lot more artsy and stuff so I think because of his influence Im kind of a bit more appreciative of things that I would have maybe just kind of like disregarded before. Um Like um when we was down in New York there we went to MOMA and there was like um the Scream by Munch or Moonch . . . . . . whatever which was there and some Van Gogh Starry Night and some lilies by Monet. So I [??] with that. But you know what? He will probably want to hear about this so Ill go and Ill take some photos for him. Um and then Harry is the youngest one hes kind of like just gets away with everything being the youngest. But um should be pretty good to go back around Christmas and catch it with them and stuff. Um probably not get back over to Cambridge in the UK over Christmas break but I try to keep in contact with friends from there through like Facebook and stuff. Um and yeah just really enjoying my time here at the moment. Thats a little bit of background on me and my family. Uh so this Im here on my third year what you call junior year my first two years in Cambridge I was part of like the Student Council for the college there while I was in college. So as part of that we do have like we call it Thrashers Week where as you kind of call it Freshman Rush dorm exploration or whatever um so we had a big kind of end to that week finale event that kind of took over college like multiple music stages and the legal drinking age in the UK is 18 so everyone at university could drink so there were different promotions on different um bars all over the place in the college different attractions and stuff. So um just kind of planning that deciding what the theme would be um how we were going to decorate up the colours to tie in with that and getting music acts um getting promotions on the main bar and just making sure we were covered health and safety wise in terms of enough canisters fire extinguisher points emergency plans and obviously working as part of a committee on that and being responsible for individual sections particularly [??] being responsible for a particular area I think thats quite a practical hands-on time when Ive been given leadership and I think I done well with it. It was yeah. Right. So um again going thinking back to Cambridge in the UK um we one of the things that Cambridge is known quite well for is Rowing so I got to Cambridge and I was like ah Ive never tried rowing before Ill take this up. So um in my first year there was me and a few of my friends took it up and we continued it into our second year but one of friends then decided he didnt have time for it and just kin- kinda dropped it to the wayside but we had the big kind of races that are towards the end of the summer there theyre called the Maybumps [SP]. And obviously any kind of sport team work is important but in rowing so much of it is just getting in time with each other working as one and it takes like the whole year to build up this. So him deciding to [??] was really going to be massively detrimental cause you can get someone to sub in and fill his seat but its not the same. Um so convincing him to stay on as part of the team and kind of rallying like getting a good like boat spirit that we werent just here guys that kind of rowed but we all got along well and we actually wanted to row for each other. And because I had been given responsibility as Boat Captain no like the overall boat club captain but that boat. So um doing things like havin um pre-race meetings together and watching like video clips before like kind of motivation Rocky style stuff. Um and just making sure like we were training hard but people were enjoying training and it was the right kind of balance between yeah we need to train at this level to be good but we dont need to go absolutely overboard and we can gauge when people just need time off or need time to unwind or de-stress. Um so kind of implementing that and it came round to the actual Bumps races he hadnt quit and um we managed to do a lot better than the previous term previous term being a bit of a disaster then this term we actually the best boat from the college. So that was pretty satisfying. Um like again it just kind of shows like the races are painful and tough but you work together to get through them you feel good after. So that was like a pretty obvious sporting example of teamwork.   Um I think overall Im quite like confident and happy to talk to people and stuff but maybe a weakness could be that sometimes I do dive into things a little too eagerly like um it could almost be that I could become better at these kind of interviews by just having the that extra confidence to just sit there quietly for 20-30 seconds think what the question actually specifically asked and answer it rather than thinking okay theyve stopped talking I better start and just diving in with an answer. And Im coming across then as perhaps a bit frantic or not completely focused. So I think some of that is just going to be practice  like do interviews get comfortable with sitting with a little bit of silence while I compose my thoughts and going into a well structured answer rather than just diving straight in with an answer as Ive kind of been doing I think so far. [laugh] Um Actually youve done surprisingly good so far. Uh so now think of a job that youd like to have. So why do you think we should hire you? Um I think that obviously to hire someone they need to have the qualifications that are gonna allow them to do well in the job but like almost any job um in todays world isnt going to be specifically tied down to one individuals sector. Its going to require skills that cross a variety of disciplines and I think that like Ive used my university time so far in the UK and in America really broadening the experience that Ive got. Uh broadening my uh ex- exposure to different fields of engineering.-hmm. And also using the really quite amusing house program you have here to broaden my exposure to even like artsy stuff. Um I also think that through like projects lab work and things of that nature I have the skills to work in a team. Be that having the uh kind of humility to accept okay theres someone more experiences more knowledgeable than me in this Ill take the lead from them or Ill start realizing when its an appropriate time Ill take the lead here because no one else is really going to or Im the best qualified to really take command. -hmm. So like in terms of working with others thats a strength that I have um and I think in terms of contributing to like the overall atmosphere in the company Im quite a pleasant optimistic person. I like to think that Im someone that others would be happy to work around so not only would I be working well but others would be working well um through my being there. Um Im not saying like Im going to suddenly make the company like 200% more profitable but I do think that Ill feedback in as much benefit as Ill get out of a job that I genuinely enjoy. OK.

48,48,p66, Im doing pretty good How about you? Yeah its kinda shitty outside haha. Gotcha. Yeah I thought it was going to snow but Ill take like drizzle over that. Uhm.. So Im a junior obviously here at MIT. Im studying chemical biological engineering and minoring in economics. Uhm I live in Cap Sigma which is one of the fraternities on campus. Im from Chicago. Uhm actually I was just home recently for Thanksgiving. Uhm and then here on campus I obviously go to class and when Im not in class I do the like getting involved in my fraternity as well as uhm I try to help with Habitat for Humanity so I do a lot with them and some community service stuff that we have as well. Oh cool. Where? Okay Im from Siokee. Uhm so if I had to give I guess an example of leadership..uhm.. recently this semester Id probably talk about uhm working with Habitat for Humanity like I mentioned before uhm Im currently the president of the club and uhm so we do a couple of different things on campus here both on and off campus uhm related to like international organization and so one of the big things we do on campus is we uhm have what we call the Beaverdash. And its a 5k run around the West end of campus. And weve done it about 5 of them now. So this year has since I was in charge of the club I had to organize it uhm and it was kind of a unique situation because uhm... We were working with the Presidents office. Uh combining with President Griphes inauguration night. Actually they contacted me Uh which was awesome because like they have a ton of money*laughs* And resources that I normally wouldnt have. So I uh was able to work with that. but I think it was a very interesting leadership posi- uh position because I was networking with my own execs which is 10 of my own students that I work with. As well as the greater club which is about 100 kids that actively participate. But then also in conjunction with the Presidents office which is a couple people in uh staff uhm. With like uh the Z center and things like that. So we were all working together to organize this larger than normal event in conjunction with other activities going on that weekend. So it definitely took like going to meetings with like staff and more important people in the world of MIT. And like relaying messages and working with like my own board and getting stuff done. And selling tickets and actually running the event and coordinating the volunteers and things like that. So I think it was a really good leadership opportunity and I worked with a lot of interesting people. Uhm lets think of a good challenge. Uhm.. Okay so uhm more recently I was working on well Im involved with my fraternity. One of my objectives was to plan a little retreated that we have like going camping. So as part of that I work with a team of people some of them are freshmen which is who the retreat is meant for. Some of the are my friend well everyones my friend but so its like an interesting dynamic because youre working with your friends but you have to kinda be managing them and stuff like that. So that was like challenge number one. But then the real challenge was to coordinate essentially like we had 60 people and we wanted to go camping somewhere. The real challenge we had was getting people to commit and to count accurate numbers and stuff like that. So I was really able to like in the context of the team organize people to go and personally talk to like all 60 people. So we could get a feel for like who was actually coming. Because an issue we had in the past 50 people would say they wanted to come but only 40 people would show up. Those 10 people are actually like hundreds of dollars wasting. and so its really important to get an accurate count and finding out who has dietary restrictions who had certain. Traditionally it is really nice to use like email to talk to people but here weve been really utilizing uhm actually going in person and having meetings together and breaking out and talking to individuals and then like doing allocation of like who was going to call the various utilities whether it be car rental or food purchase or stuff like that. Uhm so theres a lot of different allocation of uh tasks and then like individual talking to people and so those kinda overcame those different challenges. Yeah. So uhm my greatest weakness currently uhm the best way I guess to phrase it would be I guess I feel like I need to be very involved in things I do whether they be like if Im doing a project or leading an activity I feel like I need to be very on top of whats going on - which is of course a good thing you obviously if your in charge of something you want to be aware of whats happening. But I think its my weakness because it allows me to not allocate enough to other people and it cop me to stress myself out and possibly not have as good as a final project because Ive taken too much on for myself. So thats obviously a kind of weakness and uhm what Ive kinda been currently doing to counter it.. is uhm really working on finding like friends to kinda like overview what Im doing especially if Im involved in. Very specifically delligating stuff to them and working on kinda like not doing as much and trusting others to do stuff and get the job done and let someone work without checking in to really promote like letting them to go do their own thing and not concern myself with it obviously responsibly but also at the same time to not over burden myself. Okay. Uhhhmmm sure. Uhm so I think I bring a lot to the table by having been here for 2 and a half years here at MIT. Ive gained a lot of technical skills of course Ive taken a lot of classes and done a lot of laboratory research. Ive done a lot of projects through those classes. And so I think I have a lot of technical skills and uhm I in this position at this company would really have the ability to take these skills and combine them and applying them with the other skills Ive picked up here which are leadership and communication skills. Uhm cause right now theyve kinda been in separate realms where I do a lot of activities on campus where Ive had the opportunity to plan events and Ive kinda been able to take those skills and apply them towards like a technical related problem on which I would be able to do at this company and hone both of those together which I think would be very advantageous for me and very advantageous for you as a company Uhm and really allow me to show off the abilities Ive learned here.

49,49,p67, Im actually doing pretty well. Im just uh I would say well lets see. Its the end of the semester right after Thanksgiving break. So I have a bunch of time to relax and that sort of thing. This is the first time I didnt get home though. Um so I spent a bunch of time actually with my friends from my fraternity. And we had Thanksgiving dinner together. The turkey the whole shebang. Um most people around this time have all sort of exams that sort of thing. But all things considered compared to like freshman sophomore junior year um Im actually taking an extra semester to technically still a junior. Um its pretty relaxed. Things are good. Well to start um I guess to start. The three things Im doing right now: Im president of my fraternity SAE which I also helped start up. Its just one of the new fraternities that just you know came out of nowhere. We were back on campus awhile ago but thats history um. Im a late grower and Im also a chemical engineer. Most people have to say Course 10 for their major that sort of thing uh. And Im part of the growing engineer leadership program. So uh all things considered I would say that the the things that Ive come to learn the most since coming to MIT are leadership skills being confident being able to go in front of people and uh sort of create a vision. Helping people follow that vision. I have had issues in the past of time management. But I spent a long time doing like freshman sophomore year learning the importance of sleep. Bunch of things like that. Ive gone through the whole all the trials and tribulations. But all things considered Id say pretty much right now Im smooth like in a groove doing my own kind of thing. Things that I want to do. And having a good time. Well just like this whole semester. Um since Ive been like the president of my fraternity there have been situations with people who are called brothers. Where they for some reason they have these issues that they cant talk about. Im the kind of person that I can tell when someone is having. I sort of like pry not pry but press a little bit until they either like to decided to like tell me more or tell me whats going on. There was one case in the sense that mattered but there was a person that um that became a pledge of our fraternity he came from the previous president. Its called rush (talking over each other). Basically what happened is this guy came in and very few people knew him when he came in but once they got to know him over the summer they didnt like him at all. So I had to deal with the situation of trying to find out what to do. Like do we let him stay? Or let him go through the program and see if he improves? Or do we sort of like nip it in the bud right there? Uh it brought first off I didnt even want to bring that information up until Id talked to a bunch of people. So I talked to a bunch of people individually got a feel for it. Then I sort of predicted how the conversation was going to go. Ultimately what ended up happening was uh We had to find a really nice way of letting the guy go. It was sort of touchy feely sensitive stuff. I really had to let to make sure I talked to everyone before that happened. s an excellent example of leadership. So this is a similar question but related. Tell me about a time when you worked on a team and you faced a challenge. Not this time a different one. Course 10. Chemical engineering. ICE. You are given a challenge in a team. Most people you can actually choose your team. Most people throughout there are there fun people good at working with (inaudible) that sort of thing. Uh but by the time I went to choose my team most of my friends had been swooped up. So I was working with kind of a random group of people. Which kind of worked out. It turned out pretty well. The project itself. You have to design a chemical engineering plant. So you have to do the reactors you have to do the flow the mass flow the distribution com center etc. And then theres a big report. Theres all sorts of stuff. In general breakdown theres one person who sort of becomes like the expert for the program the Aspen program. And then theres another person whose more like working on the actual write up and then theres another person that sort of integrates the two. What what as the question? Working in a team? Ok um I guess the biggest issue that came up in that project was the deadline. Two and three days before the actual deadline the final project was due the main issue came up the kiln wasnt working the project wasnt working. So its a pretty typical MIT scenario. The main thing that was the issue was that the guy that was responsible for doing the coding was a really silent guy. So he was like the silent coder that was off doing his own work when youre trying to integrate it into the rest of the project um we should have collaborating a lot but this other guy was sort of off in his own world. So when we needed his part of the project it was sort of difficult to do. So what we had to do was we had to sit down all three of us together and go play by play with this guy to sort of get the medium that they left. To sort of get the project together. Um and I would say the hardest part was just interacting with this man because he was very quiet. He did get a lot of quality work done but looking back what I would have tried to do better was noticed he was a quieter person and really tried to get him to be more uh evocative. You know sharing the thoughts and stuff that he was doing during like the feed. The project we ended up delivering on time up to spec but it would have been better if we had started with the issue at the beginning. Yeah. ve done to overcome them. At the end of every single like group that Im with everyone gets to the sort of critique phase where they see what theyve done well and what they havent done as well. I can sort of like come of as being a little bit well gregarious is one thing. Um but also sometimes I can sort of dominate a conversation. Um so thats one thing I learned from the Growing Engineer leadership program. And the identify each of your skills and find out that youre bad at it. And the thing that Im really trying to work on is not dominating the conversation. Ive been working on it over the years. And the main ways I try to do that is first off dont be the guy who always takes the leadership role right from the get go. What I do is instead if theres a little bit of if some one is having a hard time Ill start giving suggestions. And then people can start jumping on to those suggestions. And if I notice there is a person who is really good at like engaged who really wants to take this forward. Ill find a way to make it so they become the leader. And so instead of me directing everyone and sort of imposing I really ask for everyones input. And make it so everyone feels involved. So this is more of not a one example but a change thats in progress. I think how I was at the beginning just sort of loud mouth asking a lot of questions like sort of this is how we are going to do everything. Now its like I volley around ideas and try to get other peoples input instead. Yeah Ive been thinking about that for awhile. Well the thing about consulting is that the main reason why its intriguing me right now is because its the kind of job where everything is fast paced. But two its the critical factor is teamwork. Working with other people who are a variety of ages. Being able to extract information and essentially be able to do a project that has a very short timeline. It has a timeline it has a scope got a budget. Being able to do find different resources make connections and building relationships with new people. Which I think is one of the most important things building relationships with people is critical. And then being able to sort of patent those new projects while also being find out or getting a breadth or a feel for so many different fields. I thought about semi-conductors and decide to not do semi-conductors because of the class Im taking right now. I think team work is the most critical part of the matter. ,"[' Im actually doing pretty well.', 'Im just uh I would say well lets see.', 'Its the end of the semester right after Thanksgiving break.',

50,50,p69, Uh so Im uh I guess I was born in DC. I lived in Maryland until I was seven. Then my parents decided it would be a good idea to move to Nigeria which is where were from. And I lived the next seven years of my life there and I came back to America for Junior and Senior year of college of high school. Once I did that um in Sag (?). But like during that period I sort of I found an interest in kind of engineering so I decided to apply at MIT you know its the best engineering school. And I uh I got accepted there. And Im here right now in Junior year. Uh yeah. Thats all. Acted as a leader um well in my one of my classes I was taking this semester its uh 212 Intro to Robotics and it was uh like the lab portion of the class is a group project and so there are four people and there has to be a team leader to get everyone organized and get everyone on the same page. Everyone know whats going on. Um and I sort of volunteered myself uh as a leader and its been its actually been much harder than I thought. Working with different people who want do to different things I guess for this project and so just organizing everyone and sort of focusing everyone has been an interesting challenge.  Uh uh uh I guess for my another class Im taking this semester which is Design and Manufacturing theres a group of eight people and were tasked with designing and manufacturing a hundred helios (sp) um yeah and so I guess the the the prerequisite to the class was uh Design and Manufacturing 1 where we had to make one robot. And sort of that was more individual but here were tasked with the the big thing here is manufacturing and so I its easy for everyone to want to decide to design this helio but you have to consider the manufacturing aspect like how easy would it be to make if youre making a ton of them. And so this was a challenge getting everyone to agree on sort of one design idea and I sort of I brought up I made it I made sure to let everyone know it wasnt just the design that were worrying about its also and more so the manufacturing aspects. Uh so Im not I say I like public speaking but Im not very good at it. I say thats one of my greatest weaknesses um and sort of working on it hasnt been hard just because its something I like doing. Um and so like given opportunities I try to be the leader of a certain group. That way I talk to Im talking to the whole group a lot. That sort of helps my speaking. And just like in class projects particularly humanities I try to focus on taking ones where theres public speaking involved not just writing essays. Okay. Yeah sure. Uh because I am as Im a junior at MIT and um this is a good place to find sort of the best engineers some of the best engineers in the world and student sort of interns and Id do Id do a great job interning at this company sort of because of the experience I have previously and the knowledge combine that with the knowledge Im getting here at a world class institute. I think thatd make me well-qualified.,"[' Uh so Im uh I guess I was born in DC.', 'I lived in Maryland until I was seven.', 'Then my parents decided it would be a good idea to move to Nigeria which is where were from.', 'And I lived the next seven years of my life there and I came back to America for Junior and Senior year of college of high school.', 'Once I did that um in Sag (?).', 'But like during that period I sort of I found an interest in kind of engineering so I decided to apply at MIT you know its the best engineering school.', 'And I uh I got accepted there.', 'And Im here right now in Junior year.', 'Uh yeah.', 'Thats all.', 'Acted as a leader um well in my one of my classes I was taking this semester its uh 212 Intro to Robotics and it was uh like the lab portion of the class is a group project and so there are four people and there has to be a team leader to get everyone organized and get everyone on the same page.', 'Everyone know whats going on.', 'Um and I sort of volunteered myself uh as a leader and its been its actually been much harder than I thought.', 'Working with different people who want do to different things I guess for this project and so just organizing everyone and sort of focusing everyone has been an interesting challenge.', 'Uh uh uh I guess for my another class Im taking this semester which is Design and Manufacturing theres a group of eight people and were tasked with designing and manufacturing a hundred helios (sp) um yeah and so I guess the the the prerequisite to the class was uh Design and Manufacturing 1 where we had to make one robot.', 'And sort of that was more individual but here were tasked with the the big thing here is manufacturing and so I its easy for everyone to want to decide to design this helio but you have to consider the manufacturing aspect like how easy would it be to make if youre making a ton of them.', 'And so this was a challenge getting everyone to agree on sort of one design idea and I sort of I brought up I made it I made sure to let everyone know it wasnt just the design that were worrying about its also and more so the manufacturing aspects.', 'Uh so Im not I say I like public speaking but Im not very good at it.', 'I say thats one of my greatest weaknesses um and sort of working on it hasnt been hard just because its something I like doing.', 'Um and so like given opportunities I try to be the leader of a certain group.', 'That way I talk to Im talking to the whole group a lot.', 'That sort of helps my speaking.', 'And just like in class projects particularly humanities I try to focus on taking ones where theres public speaking involved not just writing essays.', 'Okay.', 'Yeah sure.', 'Uh because I am as Im a junior at MIT and um this is a good place to find sort of the best engineers some of the best engineers in the world and student sort of interns and Id do Id do a great job interning at this company sort of because of the experience I have previously and the knowledge combine that with the knowledge Im getting here at a world class institute.', 'I think thatd make me well-qualified.']","[array([0.15643013, 0.1114523 , 0.44890675, 0.00163992, 0.2815709 ],

51,51,p7, Hi Im Jacob. Pleased to meet you. Good. How are you? Im a junior at MIT studying math and science and Im looking for a summer internship at your company this summer. So Im actually currently president of two student groups on campus. The Educational studies program which runs uh large scale educational programs for middle and high school students where they take classes taught by MIT students. And the MIT Mystery Hunt  which is a one weekend event in January with thousands of MIT students and other community members come to participate in a large multi-day sort of puzzle competition. Id be happy to go into detail about either of those but I have plenty of stories to tell Okay. So one thing that comes to mind is a couple months ago I was in a robotics competition at MIT called Mass Lab. So its an autonomous robotics competition where you have to design build program the robot from scratch. And I was in charge of programming the robot for the team. We ran into several problems with the vision libraries we were trying to use in order to try to track the balls and field elements just werent working for us. We spent probably the first half of the month trying to get these to work for the team and um eventually just decided that it would be easier for us to start from scratch and uh write everything ourselves. Sort of by you know throwing out the assumption that we should work with the code we were given and starting from (?) principles we were able to actually um get our vision to be at a level above most of the other teams because we could sort of custom write the code to be specific to the task at hand rather than trying to adapt general libraries. Okay. Um I guess one of the weaknesses Ive found is that I tend not to know when to ask for help. So for instance at my internship last summer this is something that my mentor pointed out to me several times. If I got stuck on a problem I would just see what I could do about it you know Google around for the solution see if anyone else had encountered the problem and then only after a couple of days of trying to work around it then talk to someone. Whereas you know if I just asked someone for help the first day they could say Oh I ran into this problem last month. This is how you fix it and avoid me sort of this hassle of trying to Google and figure it out on my own. So I um I definitely started to become more aware of this over the summer and made a conscious effort to when I was having a problem you know look at my watch and figure out how much time I was wasting trying to solve it. If it got to me more than half an hour on my own I would just poke someone next to me and ask them. I think just sort of continuing that and trying to make sure that Im keeping up the habit of ensuring that Im not getting stuck on my own should help. Okay. Thats an interesting question. Um I think I think so a lot of the candidates youve seen probably um come in with similar abilities. You know students at schools like MIT tend to be very top at the top of their class. Um so I wouldnt say theres much that differentiates me there. But I would say that I think I would get along well with your company. Um I people who have worked with me before have told me that Im just sort of a fun person to be on a team with. Um so if you sort of look out to other aspects beyond just the numbers or GPA or whats on my resume you know try to maybe you know if you want me to hang around at have hang out at the office for a couple of days and you know work with you guys we can see how that goes Im confident that uh youd think I you would conclude that I would be a good fit here.

Um I would say so uh Im the vice president of Campus Outreach here at MITs teenage beauty. Um yeah so were in charge of generally reaching out to the student population here at MIT. Um so what Ive done is basically try and form partnerships with maybe clinics in the Boston area like Fenway Health and try to get them to maybe set up screenings here at MIT. Um I would say probably in my previous lab this past summer I worked in Israel and we were having a lot of trouble with just um figuring out a protocol for how to um culture the bacteria that we were trying to do. So it was generally just like getting input from everybody and um trying not to get heated because we were kind of like pressed for results. Uh I would say one weakness is probably that I dont um speak up very much or I would prefer not to speak up maybe so that probably maybe leaves opportunities or maybe give less input than I would in certain situations. So um what Im doing to overcome that is probably more of maybe not concrete things really but hopefully just trying to get more experience so that I can maybe feel more confident about myself.

So in high school I was really involved on the robotics team. Um there I had three other teammates. And it was very difficult to narrow down ideas everyone had like different views different opinions about how we should do things.

One of my weaknesses is kind of um going out of my comfort zone as far as what Im studying. So I think that uh in high school because I was so involved in robotics I didnt really look outside of mechanical engineering. And then my parents are also architects which is where that came from.

One of the members uh wasnt contributing their work on time and so we had to resolve that. So um we- the members who had been working together uh got together and we decided that call that person in and just sort of discussed it with them and said that it was holding everyone back. And uh we were able to resolve it. Uh one of my weaknesses would probably be shyness. Um or fear of like talking in front of people I guess. Um but- so Ive been doing more projects. A lot of times in linguistics we have to give presentations so um Ive been doing more of that. And I actually uh volunteered to teach a splash class this fall so that involves getting up in front of a lot of people and teaching something.

55,55,p73, Im good how are you? Im Amanda Im a freshman at MIT. So. Im currently looking into too courses six and eighteen. So. And I play cello in the orchestra and Im a part of Sigma Kappa. Yeah one time in High School I was the President of our youth board for United Way which is a non profit that raises money and awareness for social and economic problems. And then we build and try to change them. And so my senior year as part of the youth board we ended up fundraising and starting a new fundraiser. And it was hockey game between our hockey team and a private schools hockey team. Which wasnt really a fair game but thats okay. And it was very down to the wire which we werent aware of. I mean planning an event around winter break is never really easy schedule wise and stuff. But it was definitely a challenge for us but it was it ended up being successful and we raised over $4000 for us. Yea. The organization is definitely one of my favorite um it lets students um like have a way to give back to the community which was a big deal for us since actually that year we lost three kids to suicides via train in a few months. And so it was really nice for us to have a way to like actually give back to our community instead of just thinking about it and wishing we could do something so it worked out really nicely for us to like really make a difference. I mean in school we get a lot of projects that are group projects. And I have noticed that a tend to be a person who when the slack doesnt you know the slack starts to happen is kind of do it and after a while it gets very taxing to pick up for everyone and so I remember senior year we just had this project um in Math. And it was just so frustrating to do it by myself and so I set every one and I was like I cant do this on my own anymore and I really need your help. And it was really nice because they were my friends and they didnt realize they were doing it. And so we like made up a new plan and re divied the work and it worked out in the end. Yea. Im kind of a perfectionist and I like everything to work out well. Which means that when Im starting something new sometimes I cant look over the little details that I dont see that will work.  And I dont get how you can just look past that to see a bigger picture and come with a big idea and then work on the small details later and kind of more detail oriented and then work for the bigger goal. So thats definitely been one of my problems and I have been working on getting over that. But just thinking about it in the future and just you know you can get there and you look at the bigger goal and then if you divvy it up into smaller tasks its a lot easier to overcome and deal with everything so. I think you should hire me because I have had a lot of experience dealing with other people and communicating and making sure that coming up like to come up with the best solution that everyone can hopefully agree with. And you know of course not everyone can get their way but its important to try and get everyones ideas into one if you can so.,"[' Im good how are you?', 'Im Amanda Im a freshman at MIT.', 'So.', 'Im currently looking into too courses six and eighteen.', 'So.', 'And I play cello in the orchestra and Im a part of Sigma Kappa.', 'Yeah one time in High School I was the President of our youth board for United Way which is a non profit that raises money and awareness for social and economic problems.', 'And then we build and try to change them.', 'And so my senior year as part of the youth board we ended up fundraising and starting a new fundraiser.', 'And it was hockey game between our hockey team and a private schools hockey team.', 'Which wasnt really a fair game but thats okay.', 'And it was very down to the wire which we werent aware of.', 'I mean planning an event around winter break is never really easy schedule wise and stuff.', 'But it was definitely a challenge for us but it was it ended up being successful and we raised over $4000 for us.', 'Yea.', 'The organization is definitely one of my favorite um it lets students um like have a way to give back to the community which was a big deal for us since actually that year we lost three kids to suicides via train in a few months.', 'And so it was really nice for us to have a way to like actually give back to our community instead of just thinking about it and wishing we could do something so it worked out really nicely for us to like really make a difference.', 'I mean in school we get a lot of projects that are group projects.', 'And I have noticed that a tend to be a person who when the slack doesnt you know the slack starts to happen is kind of do it and after a while it gets very taxing to pick up for everyone and so I remember senior year we just had this project um in Math.', 'And it was just so frustrating to do it by myself and so I set every one and I was like I cant do this on my own anymore and I really need your help.', 'And it was really nice because they were my friends and they didnt realize they were doing it.', 'And so we like made up a new plan and re divied the work and it worked out in the end.', 'Yea.', 'Im kind of a perfectionist and I like everything to work out well.', 'Which means that when Im starting something new sometimes I cant look over the little details that I dont see that will work.', 'And I dont get how you can just look past that to see a bigger picture and come with a big idea and then work on the small details later and kind of more detail oriented and then work for the bigger goal.', 'So thats definitely been one of my problems and I have been working on getting over that.', 'But just thinking about it in the future and just you know you can get there and you look at the bigger goal and then if you divvy it up into smaller tasks its a lot easier to overcome and deal with everything so.', 'I think you should hire me because I have had a lot of experience dealing with other people and communicating and making sure that coming up like to come up with the best solution that everyone can hopefully agree with.', 'And you know of course not everyone can get their way but its important to try and get everyones ideas into one if you can so.']","[array([0.23260541, 0.00101473, 0.00569431, 0.00083825, 0.75984734],

56,56,p74, Okay Im a computer science major um Im a senior at MIT and Im hoping to stay in the area next year. Im looking for a job here. And I grew up in South Dakota and little bit in Cambodia grew up on a farm. I really enjoy playing music and cooking. Probably my two biggest hobbies. Well when I was in high school I was the leader of my 4-H club and that involved leading meetings. There were a lot of younger kids were involved and I helped them get involved in sewing competitions for example and um things where they could learn about nutrition. Um and showing their animals and learning about how to raise an animal well. So that was a big leadership role and it was kind of difficult but I definitely learned a lot from it. Um I play music with some of my friends in some social settings. Weve played for a couple of weddings and its sometimes difficult to coordinatewhat we would like to play and how wed like to practice and the styles of music that wed like to play um and to do that properly you just need to communicate a lot um and you need to be willing to sometimes do the things that you really dont want to do. One of my weaknesses is probably procrastination same as a ton of people Im sure. To overcome that I am trying to structure my time and I have a schedule so that Ill do one thing for an hour and one thing for the next hour so if I procrastinate for the whole hour then I feel bad.

57,57,p76, Im doing well. Thanks. Well Im Zainab Lasisi-hmm. Im a junior majoring in chemical engineering. I was originally born in Nigeria. Which is in West Africa. -hmm. And I grew up in England and Jamaica before coming to MIT. A time I demonstrated leadership. Id probably say at the moment um in my position as the Vice President of the African Students Association at MIT. -hmm. So as the vice president I have to be bas- I have to basically support the president. And whenever the president of the association is not there step in. And actually be the leader for the association. -hmm. So the African Students Association is about an organization of uhh that consists of. That comprises of about 80 Africans at MIT. And its just all undergraduates. And its all about just keep the African community alive. -hmm. And just so that people know that they have a support system. -hmm. Within uh MIT. -hmm. Cause most of them are like international students. -hmm. So theyre very far away from home. So its like having a home away from home... ...for them. Yeah. Id probably say my past internship with BP. Um I was working on a team. I was a process engineer intern. And the challenge I had was that I was given a project that they didnt really know what. They hadnt the project hadnt been done before. Its just something like they had ideas about what they wanted. -hmm. But they had no clear cut visions... ...or anything. We just knew the I guess the skill set. And the types of things they want from my project. So for me just to go about delivering a a tool thats of use to the entire team. It is about working with people communicating asking them questions...-hmm. ...about what exactly it is they what me to do. And then doing. Then I did like a few modeling things. And then Ill show them and then theyll give me feedback and then Ill do some more. So that was more about it cause I dont think they had an idea about what they wanted... ...in the first place. They just knew okay we want this model to do this and do that and do that. Were not too sure how its going to do it but you know just come up with some things. -hmm. It was all on me to use my creativity and just pick peoples brains and just come up with. Deliver something thats of use to the team. I think on of my weaknesses is that um. Id say Im a very independent worker. So sometimes... ...I try like I dont I- I work too much by myself. Whereas in I do work well in teams but I just need to be more forth-. Because when Im given a project Im like okay I can do this. Ill just try to sort it out. So I guess one of my weaknesses is like approaching other people... ...especially people that Im not I dont really know. And like asking them questions and things like that. So yeah. Something I need to to develop my communication skills a little better. So. I think that I am-. I have a wonderful personality. Im great to work with. I will do anything that is asked of me...-hmm. ...with a smile on my face. Ill always try my best. -hmm. And Ill be a team player. ,"[' Im doing well.', 'Thanks.', 'Well Im Zainab Lasisi-hmm.', 'Im a junior majoring in chemical engineering.', 'I was originally born in Nigeria.', 'Which is in West Africa.', '-hmm.', 'And I grew up in England and Jamaica before coming to MIT.', 'A time I demonstrated leadership.', 'Id probably say at the moment um in my position as the Vice President of the African Students Association at MIT.', '-hmm.', 'So as the vice president I have to be bas- I have to basically support the president.', 'And whenever the president of the association is not there step in.', 'And actually be the leader for the association.', '-hmm.', 'So the African Students Association is about an organization of uhh that consists of.', 'That comprises of about 80 Africans at MIT.', 'And its just all undergraduates.', 'And its all about just keep the African community alive.', '-hmm.', 'And just so that people know that they have a support system.', '-hmm.', 'Within uh MIT.', '-hmm.', 'Cause most of them are like international students.', '-hmm.', 'So theyre very far away from home.', 'So its like having a home away from home... ...for them.', 'Yeah.', 'Id probably say my past internship with BP.', 'Um I was working on a team.', 'I was a process engineer intern.', 'And the challenge I had was that I was given a project that they didnt really know what.', 'They hadnt the project hadnt been done before.', 'Its just something like they had ideas about what they wanted.', '-hmm.', 'But they had no clear cut visions... ...or anything.', 'We just knew the I guess the skill set.', 'And the types of things they want from my project.', 'So for me just to go about delivering a a tool thats of use to the entire team.', 'It is about working with people communicating asking them questions...-hmm.', '...about what exactly it is they what me to do.', 'And then doing.', 'Then I did like a few modeling things.', 'And then Ill show them and then theyll give me feedback and then Ill do some more.', 'So that was more about it cause I dont think they had an idea about what they wanted... ...in the first place.', 'They just knew okay we want this model to do this and do that and do that.', 'Were not too sure how its going to do it but you know just come up with some things.', '-hmm.', 'It was all on me to use my creativity and just pick peoples brains and just come up with.', 'Deliver something thats of use to the team.', 'I think on of my weaknesses is that um.', 'Id say Im a very independent worker.', 'So sometimes...', '...I try like I dont I- I work too much by myself.', 'Whereas in I do work well in teams but I just need to be more forth-.', 'Because when Im given a project Im like okay I can do this.', 'Ill just try to sort it out.', 'So I guess one of my weaknesses is like approaching other people... ...especially people that Im not I dont really know.', 'And like asking them questions and things like that.', 'So yeah.', 'Something I need to to develop my communication skills a little better.', 'So.', 'I think that I am-.', 'I have a wonderful personality.', 'Im great to work with.', 'I will do anything that is asked of me...-hmm.', '...with a smile on my face.', 'Ill always try my best.', '-hmm.', 'And Ill be a team player.']","[array([8.2934934e-01, 1.9931972e-03, 6.1218231e-03, 5.6097686e-04,

58,58,p77, Mmhmm. Im goo.. Im doing well how are you? Um so I my background is in mechanical engineering. What I really enjoy doing though um is leadership type rolls. So I like talking with people but I also like doing technical problems. So Im looking for a position that really combines those two things. Uh where I can use my communications skills with people as well as my technical background in a roll thats kinda combin.. involves decision making uh and different business factors. Uh so recently umm Im the leader of our of a group project that Im working on. Basically what we have to do is design a speech system and with the system uh as leader of our team I do a lot of organizing delegating tasks uh different types of conflict management making sure people are talking understanding whatever everybodys wanting uh different type of just general making sure Im aware of all the group dynamics that are going on. Okay uhh so I was on a team uhh it was actually just two people uh but it was to design and build a robot at the end of last semester and uhh my partner and I have very different working styles which I didnt expect. I was kinda have projected my own tendencies on him in assuming that if I was going to finish something he would do the same way or work the same way as I as I was going to. Uh but it didnt end up being true and so we ended up at the very end uh not having our final product ready not having everything together and what I ended up doing was just making sure that I used all the resources I had so friends outside of the project who um were willing to help with what was going on uh to try to pull something together made sure I was going to contact my professor and then try to communicate with him as much as possible uh to collaborate with what was going on in order to get um like uh somewhat finished final project ther... that was our professor said was acceptable and done by the end about the time we had finished.. wait the time that we had to finish. Uh I think one of my main weaknesses is uh taking on too many little things. Umm so sometimes not realizing uh what the little things are that I can let go for a little bit and prioritizing uh large period of times of saying yes to too many things. Uh and what Im mainly trying to do to change that is just keeping track of exactly how I spend my time. So recently Ive been really trying to focus in on how long am I really wasting on little tasks and how long Im actually spending on larger tasks um and I and seeing that is very helpful uh in changing how I prioritize things Im very dependable. Im responsible. I will get things done when they need to be done. Uh and I like to communicate with people overcome challenges uh I have been use to working with people with very diverse backgrounds and Im not afraid of a challenge. Um Im also Im use to being a team player. Ive worked on lots of team and know people so uhh Im also very excited about the vision of the company and whats going on and I think overall uh what Ive learned here about the culture would fit me well. ,"[' Mmhmm.', 'Im goo..

59,59,p78, Um Im a junior in computer science. What sort of things do you want to know about me? I like programming in python. I havent been in computer science that long because I used to be a chemistry major. But Ive been taking computer science classes for the past year and a half. Im the president of my acapella group so I have to organize publicity things like when we have a performance I have to make sure that everyone knows about the performance so we have an audience. I organize details like the reception and the getting a room reserved. Hmm m...a time when I was working with a team...I guess if I could count my acapella group as a team. cause I guess it is. There are times when weve had conflicts about weather we wanted to sing a specific song For instance often times there would be a song that we really liked but it would take like up a lot of rehearsal time. So we didnt think it was worth it or anything cause we had limited time. So we had to resolve the conflict by discussing different options. I think we finally ended up deciding to sing the song in a future semester. Later we would still be able to sing it but it wouldnt compromise the rest of our repertoire. Hmm m...haha...um mm...cant really think of things that where weaknesses...um mm...laugh.. I guess that I have trouble being criticized because Ive always been sensitive and When I get criticized by people who arent as sensitive I I react more strongly to their criticism than they intend me to. so I have to learn to realize that some people who arent as sensitive will criticize harsh more harshly. Because Im excited to work at facebook.

60,60,p79, Im good Um Im from Mumbai . Im a junior in core six . When I applied to ITU I wasnt quite sure what I wanted to do Um I thought I would do chemical engineering . That um that got me super interested in a bunch stuff and um finally decided core six um-hmm But then I visit to the media lab before . Um now Im working at the over in um -hmm So thats and engines I have been involved with engines here and um a bunch of other um clubs like Energy Club -hmm. and organizing the Energy Conference and and other workshops . So um and in general Im super interested in um hardware show and um computer science like certain aspects of computer science really interests me too so . Yeah Im interested you know to learn Um sure . So well this is the most recent example-hmm I can think of . But I um was a freshman . I was I mean I still am pretty excited about international developments-hmm. So I joined um um as it was it was it was . It wasnt formally ? in the USA but we decided to take it on . . .-hmm. . . . we wanted so we were willing um sort of ?? low cost easy to setup showers we use in Kenya Um and it was basically something that Ive never done before -hmm. computer science people you you know trying ?? But their view was . . .-huh. . . . its not . So um that was a great thing for me to get involved with . And um that summer I went and traveled with them to Kenya-hmm. Um and that was a great experience. So coming back um I was uh elected as That was um that was a great thing cuz one its its important to kind of realize that you might not have all the answers but thats fine .-hmm. You know you can learn . You knew wanna be teens etc. But it was like despite not knowing anything about mechanical engineering I was able to sort of understand and learn um sort of graduate to eventually becoming um . . . taking on a leadership within that community Yeah. Um so we had this uh we had this asphalt called which is basically um you do you make them overlap. And you sort of um pretend as if its something that youre actually making for industry.-hmm. And um there were four people on the team to program. Whereas there was me who was kind of like I know how to do it but you know I I could do with more instruction.-hmm. There was someone who was just starting. She wa- she was a freshman that year. Um but she was great.-hmm. And uh we decided to make this app with um when you have two iPhones uh you can swipe like you can bump them and uh whatevers on one phone the other one.-hmm. could split them. It was something that you know we we hadnt done before. Not a ton of people have done it.-hmm. And um at the media lab there was this technology that of I dont know discovered ?? um called Swipe. And they just swipe from one to the other and we we thought that would be great. And it someone like a student like us who had done it.-hmm. Um we but we we didnt realize that it was not production ready and then . . . And you know we have all these bugs and stuff. And we have no documentation to go to. But there was this one person on the team you know being you know the awesome programmer he is insisted on going that way when . . . Like when we met the founder of Swipe he was saying you know what just dont use it its not optimized for the stuff that you guys are sending . . .-hmm. . . . across like the data. And um so we have the sort of tiff when you know the rest of the team wanted to move on to do the same project using the VPI.-hmm. Which was kind of standard . . . . . . ?? And whereas we infinitely could deduce fiber we just didnt the resources at the time.-hmm. So um you know he was re- he was really experienced and he cant even say you know you dont what you are doing. Because he . . . . . . didnt know . . . . . . what he doing. So eventually we were able to convince him that we should probably go with whatever we wanted . . .-hmm. . . . um as a team instead of you know . . . etc. Um so that was that was definitely a challenging situation cuz hes great. Hes smart.-hmm. And hes super nice and you dont wanna offend anyone. Especially when theyre your friends.-hmm. You you have to get the work done. Is this a technical weakness or . . . OK. Um a lot of times this is just something that Cody just taught me. That I havent quite learned um is that whenever youre you know whenever youre in doubt you should just go ahead and do stuff.-hmm. But for me I like to like think about it how exactly Im gonna lose one . . .-hmm. . . . if ?? coding. Which which which is a problem because sometimes like new solutions come along the way but you can like I do it fast. Um and its OK if stuff work the first time. Cuz I kind of wanted to research everything before . . . . . . I start doing stuff. Um thats sometimes an issue because then I cant do it as fast.-hmm. If especially if thats something new. But um on the other hand sometimes if it works like it works really well cuz Ive done my you know homework. Right? But uh in general I like if you just just get my hands dirty and then do stuff. Yeah. Um well because a year ago I didnt know how to code at all. And now like like next semester Im gonna finish up my degree.-hmm. Um as a junior. And then Ill probably do math or something else. But it that just kind of shows you that Im willing to learn. And Im not afraid of trying new stuff. And with this technology will always change. And sure if I dont PHP today right now you can use it tomorrow.-hmm. But um I think whats really important is that Im willing to learn um and I work well with within a team.

61,61,p8, Im doing great how are you? Uh so Im an undergraduate uh in the third year at uh here at MIT and Im studying computer science. Um I am really interested in um applying for a software job.Um I want to get more experience in web development and software development and also get some exposure into data science and machine learning. And uh see how that plays out in uh the industry setting uh since Ive done some research Uhm leadership? So currently Im on uh the South Asian American Students Exec Board. So thats uh basically uh the Indian Cultural club uh for undergrads. And uh Im secretary and community service chair. Um So Im currently organizing um reaching out to groups in the Boston area um and uh groups that work overseas in India with um for charity and community service opportunities that I can connect to uh undergrads here.Um And uh Im also involved in other activities that SAS the group uh is involved in like setting up and planning like uh study breaks. Our recent uh garba which is an Indian dance festival. And also in Im in Phi Kappa Theta fraternity and uh Ive held leadership positions there uh in my freshman year in our pledge class when I was the community service chair for that as well. Uh and led my class of uh 15 in um going out into the community and we went down into different places in Boston and helped clean up streets etc. Uh so with this community service uh that my pledge class did for my fraternity. Um one glaring problem was getting everybody to respond communicate well and show up. Uh a class of 15 isnt too big but when were all MIT students were all just getting settled its kind of hard to keep everybody on task. Um so what I did to solve this problem was uh I- once I set up- One thing I did was set up a group text um that I would uh that would basically keep us on touch and um would facilitate making sure that everybody stayed involved and it would be easier to keep track also of who was actually responding. Um because people check texts better than emails and thats what wed been using previously.I also tried to um unsuccessfully but um propose uh like a point system basically. Uh to reward those who would show up and penalize those who didnt. So we also- we have chores basically in our house to keep the house looking clean- house works and crews- and um basically if you accumulated a certain number of um points- points are bad-uh you would have to do extra crews or house works depending on when you didnt show up for an event during our pledge process. I think probably my biggest weakness is uh staying focused on tasks. Um when I am working on a task and I am focused I am able to work really efficiently and I come up with good ideas. Uh but I frequently get distracted. However Ive been um well on my way to overcoming this uh through friends- working studying with friends who have like trained me to stay more on task. Uh Done things like finding better places to work and study with back to school work.Um and uh also sleep schedules are frequently a major problem for undergrads in terms of how that affects your study habits. And so uh Ive been working on that to help stay fresher and more focused when I do my work. I think you should hire me because I have a lot of ideas Im really good at coming up with ideas between table especially in terms of um software development. I um projects for school and one or two of my own independent projects Ive been working on by myself and with friends. Ive uh been good at optimization um of software and coming up with good ideas um on the user end. So uh Im able to look at a project from different stand points and think about what all parties would want. What-what would be easiest for the development team as well as the end users.

62,62,p80, Mhmm. Awesome. How about yourself? Well I grew up in Berkley California. And Ive been interested in medicine my whole life. Um my dad worked for UCSF... as a researcher but not as a doctor. And I would visit him at work and I was always attracted to the hospital side... Its much the loud side. I want to do research as well. Well in high school I was captain of golf team. And that was a blast. Golf girls golf is not super competitive... to say the least. Its very...haphazard and its usually been one extreme or another. Very bimodal. Um youve either got these like super serious girls who are parents on the course with them and theyre going to be all PGA. Or you just girls that are not that athletic just goofing off with golf clubs... and doing whatever. And Berkeley High is definitely the ladder of that. So I uh you know coordinated this group of motley girls along with my coach and we had a lot of competitions where candy was the reward. We played a lot of games--we had really a great time. But a big part of it is like... you know there was like a leadership aspect? We had to like stay organized. Especially because no one else was. And so like making sure we made it to meets and like...organizing snacks making sure people showed up. Well I mean I can continue the same example because I didnt start off as captain. And its different you know? When youre the head versus like part of the group. Um its more important when youre a part of the group to be a cohesive part and not like the leader. To be able to like understand directions and like...I mean if there is an issue like...work it out but to be able to take you know instructions and think about it and work with other people and encourage them to do the same. So uh this is one time weve encountered an issue. So we were going to a meet and you have to travel a lot for golf... because golf courses are big and not very common. Compared to something like a soccer field. So we were going out into the [xx?] of California... and our car broke down. And it was earrrly in the morning. No one had no sleep. It was just girls...teenage girls no caffeine not enough sugar not enough breakfast. And we were in a really old car... and my coach was like 30 minutes ahead and we were going to be late. We blew a tire actually. So we called triple A but it was stressful... but we ended playing games and I like led a yoga session in the...highway... which was you know hilarious. And were there in these ridiculous outfits. Were wearing like we... at Berkeley High we wore like stupid outfits... on purpose; knee high argyles and like polos. It was so funny. You can only imagine how we looked. Um yeah. So Im not super great with being organized. Like Im alright but especially with administrative things like paperwork and...uhm I...Im good with deadlines but only if I had set reminders. So like even for example trying to get into this building today was an adventure or remembering to fill out all the forms for...like my [xx?] and everything is...it can be sometimes sort of a struggle. Well I love helping people and Im going to be a great doctor. I have good dexterity. I like to study. I find medicine fascinating...fascinating. And I feel like I could really make the most impact that way I can utilize...utilize my skills the best way possible.,"[' Mhmm.', 'Awesome.', 'How about yourself?', 'Well I grew up in Berkley California.', 'And Ive been interested in medicine my whole life.', 'Um my dad worked for UCSF... as a researcher but not as a doctor.', 'And I would visit him at work and I was always attracted to the hospital side...

63,63,p81, -ology in order to learn more about like the pharmaceutical aspect of the rain. Um and so thats- Im trying to get myself towards patent law. In pharmaceuticals I guess. Well um last semester I was ah a part of the Mentor Core for a student organization on one of MITs campus called Amphibious Achievement. One of the things as part of the Mentor Core you have a small group of students that you one on one tutor as their mentor and tutor and you meet with them once a week for a five hour study session and theyre inner city High School students who - they dont have access to the best basic math and reading skills. So we meet once a week to go over what were going to teach them and we teach them the next day on a Sunday. Uhm and so thats leadership in itself but I took the initiative to plan a sponsorship banquet to thank our very generous donors and so me and another member of the Mentor Core planned uh a sponsorship banquet that I was told went very well. So Im very proud of that. Well I guess the one thing that Ive learned uhm working on several teams throughout my life is uh that communication is necessary um so uh in High School I worked on a team and we had received a grant in order to build an alternative energy um device. Um and there was a lot of issues amongst the different committees like so there was an electrical component and there were people trying to build the flotation aspect of it because it was - it was supposed to be in water and there was the water proofing committee. And so in terms of communicating deadlines and expectations I think there was a sometimes there could be a breakdown in that because everyones busy. And you see that here and I saw that a lot back in High School. Um and so I was kind of moderating everyone um and so just being able to communicate the expectations um to make it really apparent ‘cause I think we running a lot of high achieving people a lot of the time so as long as they know what they need to do and whats expected of them I think um at least for me as a high achieving person I - once I know what I need to do I can do it. And as long as thats communicated and clear I think thats necessary to resolve a lot of problems.re doing to overcome it. Id say one of my weaknesses can definitely be in terms of organization. So if theres something I know that I need to do um I will definitely get it done but in terms of parsing out the appropriate amount of time sufficiently before hand sometimes that can be lacking to where there can be times Im scrambling at the last second. I always get it done but its just in terms of personal stress and maybe stress of people who want to see results over time versus at the end um but I have Ive gotten a lot better at that especially at MIT because you really cant mess around with that kind of uh weakness. Just with knowing my schedule the month before versus the week before hand. And investing in a planner and a calendar has definitely helped me a lot. I think because you know Ive wanted to do it since I was twelve and I think I have a lot that I can give coming from Mit have a back-like the mind set the science and engineering um as and adding that into like the sphere of law I think it would introduce a unique problem solving set and I could have a lot to offer to uh the community of lawyers across the nation.,"[' -ology in order to learn more about like the pharmaceutical aspect of the rain.', 'Um and so thats- Im trying to get myself towards patent law.', 'In pharmaceuticals I guess.', 'Well um last semester I was ah a part of the Mentor Core for a student organization on one of MITs campus called Amphibious Achievement.', 'One of the things as part of the Mentor Core you have a small group of students that you one on one tutor as their mentor and tutor and you meet with them once a week for a five hour study session and theyre inner city High School students who - they dont have access to the best basic math and reading skills.', 'So we meet once a week to go over what were going to teach them and we teach them the next day on a Sunday.', 'Uhm and so thats leadership in itself but I took the initiative to plan a sponsorship banquet to thank our very generous donors and so me and another member of the Mentor Core planned uh a sponsorship banquet that I was told went very well.', 'So Im very proud of that.', 'Well I guess the one thing that Ive learned uhm working on several teams throughout my life is uh that communication is necessary um so uh in High School I worked on a team and we had received a grant in order to build an alternative energy um device.', 'Um and there was a lot of issues amongst the different committees like so there was an electrical component and there were people trying to build the flotation aspect of it because it was - it was supposed to be in water and there was the water proofing committee.', 'And so in terms of communicating deadlines and expectations I think there was a sometimes there could be a breakdown in that because everyones busy.', 'And you see that here and I saw that a lot back in High School.', 'Um and so I was kind of moderating everyone um and so just being able to communicate the expectations um to make it really apparent ‘cause I think we running a lot of high achieving people a lot of the time so as long as they know what they need to do and whats expected of them I think um at least for me as a high achieving person I - once I know what I need to do I can do it.', 'And as long as thats communicated and clear I think thats necessary to resolve a lot of problems.re doing to overcome it.', 'Id say one of my weaknesses can definitely be in terms of organization.', 'So if theres something I know that I need to do um I will definitely get it done but in terms of parsing out the appropriate amount of time sufficiently before hand sometimes that can be lacking to where there can be times Im scrambling at the last second.', 'I always get it done but its just in terms of personal stress and maybe stress of people who want to see results over time versus at the end um but I have Ive gotten a lot better at that especially at MIT because you really cant mess around with that kind of uh weakness.', 'Just with knowing my schedule the month before versus the week before hand.', 'And investing in a planner and a calendar has definitely helped me a lot.', 'I think because you know Ive wanted to do it since I was twelve and I think I have a lot that I can give coming from Mit have a back-like the mind set the science and engineering um as and adding that into like the sphere of law I think it would introduce a unique problem solving set and I could have a lot to offer to uh the community of lawyers across the nation.']","[array([0.00868056, 0.03110035, 0.8656231 , 0.00739019, 0.08720579],

64,64,p83, Umm Im good Im good. Umm so Im a junior at MIT. Im studying brain and cognitive science. Im interested in studying cognitive neuroscience in the future. Probably systems level. Ok. Umm well this past summer I was in China. And umm I was helping out with this cognitive learning program. And what they do is they try take principles umm learned through research and apply those in the classroom. And so-- we were applying those umm to students who were in sixth grade trying to teach them English. And it was it was great. So I got to actually like umm go there and teach a class of sixth graders for the whole summer. So umm and they let me develop some of their curriculum which was very cool. And umm and it was a great experience overall. Ok. Umm well actually a part of the same program uh we were trying to put up videos of the teaching to give umm examples for other people. And uh none of us knew how to program or anything like that and we were we were in China so it was umm both a language barrier and also you know like overcoming that like knowledge gap of not knowing how to program. So what we ended up doing was like trying to find a Chinese student who was studying computer science and umm in Beijing and the language thing did come in to play but umm but eventually we were able to like sort of get through that. It was a challenge all the way through. Yea umm so I have trouble public spe- like getting up in front of people and talking.- Umm which is part of why I came in to this interview. Umm but also this semester I joined the debate team. Umm which has been great so far. Umm basically we go around to different colleges for tournaments and umm we get up and we just speak for for an hour. And umm and thats thats really helped out so far. Umm because I I want to make a difference in this field. Umm Im very very committed to this [??] I mean I know this is what I want to do. I mean theres really nothing else I can see myself in the future doing. I mean I love it Im fully committed and umm Id Id like to make a difference here.,"[' Umm Im good Im good.', 'Umm so Im a junior at MIT.', 'Im studying brain and cognitive science.', 'Im interested in studying cognitive neuroscience in the future.', 'Probably systems level.', 'Ok.

65,65,p84, Im well thank you.  How about yourself? Um well as you probably know Im a Junior in MIT ah material science and engineering and ive spent a bit of time doing some research in material science but ive also recently declared a maj- ah minor in course two. Which is sorry its mechanical engineering. Umm so Im looking for a bit of practice in industry. Now that Ive had some research experience Ive a lot of range of classes in engineering.  And Im hoping to ah to kind of try out what its like to engineer um  combine the two basically mechanical and materials engineering. Ok um I could give you an example of a club Im in? Um in at MIT Im in Amnesty International which is a student human rights organization- And its very um decentralized its very student owned and uh we kinda make it what ever we wanna make it- at any given time so it takes a lot of initiative to- really hold the club together and uh we were trying to pull together a big event last semester which involved Professor N- and we had to talk about Arab spring and we were hosting it in a huge lecture hall um so big venue hoping expecting a lot of people. Um but it took a lot of work- And none of us had really pulled such a huge event before- So um Id say it took it took a lot of initiative that I hadnt taken before in pulling that event together. I came to meetings and made sure everyone was on task made sure that everybody had an awareness of what could go wrong as well as what could um what kind of repercussions we might be expecting if things did fall out of hand with the high high profile speakers- as well as some you know some contentious issues- being discussed so um yeah I did my best to really pull the team together as best as I could. Um I didnt have an official leadership role- So my participation was ambiguously defined but um it was fun having uh having a role. Um thats a good question. Um so I was on the orientation group I was an orientation leader this- this the beginning of this year and so we paired off into different groups uh we were the brown team and we had a few problems with getting energy with the team and uh all of these freshman we knew that they were excited to be there- We knew that they wanted to get to know each other and MIT but there was just there was something blocking them from talking and from getting out of orientation what they should have so we uh we pulled together as a bit of a brown group team we had a group discussion after I think it was the second day and we took this um we took a few tries to pull together some new ice breakers that hadnt been in the booklet that they prepared us for and just uh whipped that out the next day started yelling got the kids off their feet and jumping and um my one of my other co-orientation leaders and I were yelling different questions at them and they had to pair up or group up based on the question that we asked them and  it didnt really work necessarily um everybody participated though and it got them got the blood moving and it go them kind of talking to new people so even though the game didnt have a point it ended up being kind of fun it was a good good way of getting to know my teammates a well. So we worked together really well on that. Yes. Um so I have a weakness for over-committing sometimes and uh what I have been doing in the last year or so well since I came to MIT but particularly this year is cutting back on things that dont mean much to me. Cutting back on things that are that have always just been interest that I never see myself progressing in. So um for example I was uh I took a small leadership role in my sorority like my my freshman year but I wasnt I dont see myself going very far in leadership in my sorority so I cut that kind of thing out and Ive been focusing on classes sailing Im on the sailing team and uh Amnesty International and those are my three main focus things so although I do do other things. Like I was and orientation leader um when I have time I give tours from thats my job campus tour guiding but um Ive been getting better Ive been staying more on track with classes this way and um having sailing has definitely helped so a bit of self-discipline- And uh cutting back on things has helping me uh not overcommit. Um because Ive researched into your country sorry into your company and um I think uh I think its I see a lot of I see a lot it in the experience that Ive had in Ive had international experience in companies of a scales similar to yours although it was in the research department um and I think I cold bring that coo- that um international perspective Ive lived in several countries as well uh and I have besides being and engineer I have a lot practice with team work and with leadership roles in my community and my student groups even in my p-set groups um doing homework. We have to pull together a lot of presentations and a lot of uh group reports where the materials signs major here and Ive really uh Ive developed a lot of skills that I think will really help your

66,66,p85, Okay so Im a junior here at MIT Im  um and I guess so its an interesting combo but engineering and ECS and I think I just came to MIT thinking Id do bioengineering and then I guess I took a program class for the first time my freshman year over IP and I guess I just really fell in love with the logic. I worked in a couple of biology labs and I guess the one frustrating thing is that like experiments take weeks or months to set up sometimes things just go wrong and you dont really know why. And then I think I like the instantaneous feedback of like  so last year I decided to double major and this year Im really checking out the more computer science side of things. Okay um so I think Im on my class council so one of the things we have to do was to seven people elected every year our job was to plan events for the class for event unity just like study breaks but sometimes it goes beyond that. And I guess through that role often times Ive um just like seen an idea from inception all the way to its now in planning to like delegating tasks to day of to day of execution and just following that entirely through. So I guess that just involved first just coming out brainstorming some ideas so like for example this past week on Tuesday since its a hell week for many people at MIT we decided to have instead of like a big study break where people had to go on campus we rented out a cookie monster truck from Boston and then just drove around. We had six stops on campus to like it was all the dorms and even across the river to bring the study break to them so people didnt have to spend that much time just cookies and hot cocoa. So I guess my role is well I thought of the idea and then just coordinate the people and made shifts to people and designed the stops and then just made sure publicity was good and everything came together in the end.s a very smart idea. I like it. So tell me a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you go about resolving it? Okay. So I guess Im in a fraternity and then one of the things we have like a lot of officers and I guess one of the things is that sometimes people obviously its MIT people get very busy and I guess one of the things is people maybe they have an ambitious goal and then it just happens that they get busy or like they lose track of things and then uh they get side tracked and its always challenging to try to keep them engaged into that officer position and like because for a couple of reasons: one like do you want to make it rewarding for then two you want to see them follow their goals and three theyre like setting an example for say like younger students or other people that may be interesting. So I guess the challenge then is to overcome this so Im usually following up with them individually seeing like maybe like hey like whats up are you no longer interested in this are you just busy? And then I think it depends on like a case by case basis. Like are they just maybe a little bit absent minded then maybe like setting like weekly just like deliverables or like milestones or goals to like get it done piece by piece is one way. If theyre not interested anymore maybe you try to think of like some other idea that they may be interested in or willing to plan to maybe they can work in a group with someone else so someone else can keep them on track. So I guess its just tailoring to the solution to the individual problem.s always the best approach. So unh tell me about one of your weakness and how you plan to overcome it. Okay um I think sometimes I can be um a little like uh like unsure of myself or like doubting when making a very large decision so I guess usually in leadership roles I prefer something like second in command since I do like making sure things get done and like following up to make sure but I always like the fall back of having someone else to consult with to talk about uh my thought process and things like that. And I guess generally I try just to overcome that by basically reaching out to other people like other people on the team or someone else you would maybe not  but has experience in the field just to maybe illustrate my thought process see if they see any flaws see if they see maybe a perspective I didnt think about and then just generally trying to get more viewpoints so that I feel more confident in my own decision or like I reevaluate it to account for things that maybe I didnt think of before.s always a good strategy. So now Id like you to think of a job that youd like to have. Do you have one in mind? Um so actually thats one of the things like Im hoping to figure out …t the question. I want you to picture one that youd like to have. Okay. Okay so I guess the job I picked was just to listing like Richard Keppel? Where like they listen to a lot of pitches and they decide like what to fund and I think the reason why I want to should I say why I should or why I want to have that job? Okay so why I should have the job is I think at MIT Ive gotten a lot of exposure to a lot of different things one is through the breadth of my coursework I guess Im in two very different fields. Another is just through my interaction with people on campus like being on class council being involved in a fraternity  I guess I um Ive seen like a lot of different groups of people. And um I guess Im just constantly around lots of awesome people with awesome ideas and I really enjoy just listening to them. And then a lot of the times Ive helped people to develop maybe theyve got a gold mine of a plan and Ive helped them work through especially like sophomores or freshman in the fraternity putting that plan in action. SO I think that I would be a good candidate because Ive had experience listening to ideas I can identify problem areas just because I have a lot of experience executing those ideas. So I can both see what might be a good idea technically as well as to see if theres a good plan to set forth an action and get it done. Thank you.,"[' Okay so Im a junior here at MIT Im  um and I guess so its an interesting combo but engineering and ECS and I think I just came to MIT thinking Id do bioengineering and then I guess I took a program class for the first time my freshman year over IP and I guess I just really fell in love with the logic.', 'I worked in a couple of biology labs and I guess the one frustrating thing is that like experiments take weeks or months to set up sometimes things just go wrong and you dont really know why.', 'And then I think I like the instantaneous feedback of like  so last year I decided to double major and this year Im really checking out the more computer science side of things.', 'Okay um so I think Im on my class council so one of the things we have to do was to seven people elected every year our job was to plan events for the class for event unity just like study breaks but sometimes it goes beyond that.', 'And I guess through that role often times Ive um just like seen an idea from inception all the way to its now in planning to like delegating tasks to day of to day of execution and just following that entirely through.', 'So I guess that just involved first just coming out brainstorming some ideas so like for example this past week on Tuesday since its a hell week for many people at MIT we decided to have instead of like a big study break where people had to go on campus we rented out a cookie monster truck from Boston and then just drove around.', 'We had six stops on campus to like it was all the dorms and even across the river to bring the study break to them so people didnt have to spend that much time just cookies and hot cocoa.', 'So I guess my role is well I thought of the idea and then just coordinate the people and made shifts to people and designed the stops and then just made sure publicity was good and everything came together in the end.s a very smart idea.', 'I like it.', 'So tell me a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.', 'How did you go about resolving it?', 'Okay.', 'So I guess Im in a fraternity and then one of the things we have like a lot of officers and I guess one of the things is that sometimes people obviously its MIT people get very busy and I guess one of the things is people maybe they have an ambitious goal and then it just happens that they get busy or like they lose track of things and then uh they get side tracked and its always challenging to try to keep them engaged into that officer position and like because for a couple of reasons: one like do you want to make it rewarding for then two you want to see them follow their goals and three theyre like setting an example for say like younger students or other people that may be interesting.', 'So I guess the challenge then is to overcome this so Im usually following up with them individually seeing like maybe like hey like whats up are you no longer interested in this are you just busy?', 'And then I think it depends on like a case by case basis.', 'Like are they just maybe a little bit absent minded then maybe like setting like weekly just like deliverables or like milestones or goals to like get it done piece by piece is one way.', 'If theyre not interested anymore maybe you try to think of like some other idea that they may be interested in or willing to plan to maybe they can work in a group with someone else so someone else can keep them on track.', 'So I guess its just tailoring to the solution to the individual problem.s always the best approach.', 'So unh tell me about one of your weakness and how you plan to overcome it.', 'Okay um I think sometimes I can be um a little like uh like unsure of myself or like doubting when making a very large decision so I guess usually in leadership roles I prefer something like second in command since I do like making sure things get done and like following up to make sure but I always like the fall back of having someone else to consult with to talk about uh my thought process and things like that.', 'And I guess generally I try just to overcome that by basically reaching out to other people like other people on the team or someone else you would maybe not  but has experience in the field just to maybe illustrate my thought process see if they see any flaws see if they see maybe a perspective I didnt think about and then just generally trying to get more viewpoints so that I feel more confident in my own decision or like I reevaluate it to account for things that maybe I didnt think of before.s always a good strategy.', 'So now Id like you to think of a job that youd like to have.', 'Do you have one in mind?', 'Um so actually thats one of the things like Im hoping to figure out …t the question.', 'I want you to picture one that youd like to have.', 'Okay.', 'Okay so I guess the job I picked was just to listing like Richard Keppel?', 'Where like they listen to a lot of pitches and they decide like what to fund and I think the

67,67,p86, Umm like where Im from that type of stuff? Okay umm Im Junior M.I.T.. I come from South Florida born and raised so cold weathers kind of rough for a guy like me but thats alright. Its kind of a nice break from the heat of South Florida. Umm Ive been playing music ever since I was four so thats kind of been a big part of my life. Umm but music tech I mean technology honestly also so umm. Course two here which is Mechanical Engineering um but Im also dabbling in Electrical looking along for sides of control that type of stuff. Robotics if you will. And just had one of my my second or third robot finished last week which was a freakin nightmare. But you know its ok its done it was it was a good time so yeah. Thats thats what I do. Yeah umm I guess thats... Yeah alright. Yeah. Leadership? Um Well I guess Im uh usually pretty calm and collected so if I ever notice like in a group setting if someones like you know theres theres disagreement between the two like in my robotics group for example. The two guys theyre best buds but they often like just get really heated like you know I eff you why why dont we just do this and that type of stuff. So... ... In order to like keep it going and being productive someone has to be like you know just guys just calm down and keep doing it so thats thats like just here and there. Not really super-like Im in control you know at least saying guys we need to calm down and take a step forward. I feel like thats a little minor leadership role Ive got to take there. Um other leadership roles um I I play in a group like a band jazz group so I often you know we all got to get together and like kind of talk. Any any group setting in which Im often in I have to like somebody has to take control and I dont often take control initially but you know if something is not going in a certain direction or the right direction I often feel like maybe I can push it there very subtly. So leadership in a very subtle way but not in a like a bam Im telling you what to do. Thats thats what I like doing. Um okay so for example the robotics group um we worked very last minute and just having to be one of those things where we were all busy with other things and we didnt really think about the scheduling like when it was actually when the project was actually going to be due. So um basically we all had to work really hard last minute and of course you know things dont always go according to plan so we like we tried to build one thing and machine something and it ended up not being perfect the first time so we have to go back and redesign it or re-machine it so uh we had to re-machine a few things a couple times. And you know its like six in the morning and youve been working in the lab for like thirteen hours and youve got to keep going so youve got to stay positive and keep and you know even though you may not finish or like you know you kind of you cant really think about not finishing. You just have to go for it keep finishing keep working eventually youre good with the mind set that you are going to finish. So thats uh adversity in that way. Just you know always stay positive and keep looking towards the future keep working. So um time-management um is one of my weaknesses which is not always the best to admit in an interview but you know whatever uh thats alright. What Ive been doing to get better about it is you know sometimes youve got to look like even a week in advance Ive discovered especially at M.I.T. isnt as far as you need to go. So like this this week for instance I had like three like a final robot project another presentation I had to take care of and you know a lab a couple P-sets. Like you just I didnt realize how much work was coming up until like last Thursday or something like that which is when I started working but even then you know I didnt have enough time. I really should have started working you know Monday on it when I was just relaxing and was like Oh you know. Ive got P-sets to do this week but I can really relax and it will be all right. So uh in terms of improving that just I you know got to work write up a schedule and look really far in advance make sure I really see whats coming. Yeah so Ive been trying Ive been being better. It started off I started college like I didnt see things for like three days in advance two days in advance. Now its kind of like a week week and a half Im looking in advance. Im getting there slowly but surely. Yeah. Okay. Uh yeah sure. For that job you mean? Umm I feel like I know what Im doing now. Um Ill say there was a point in time where I didnt feel like I knew what I was doing and Ive been one of those guys that like you know you can apply to a job and say you know yeah theres no harm in applying which Ive kind of figured out eventually yeah there is no harm in applying I agree. But at the same time I feel like theres kind of like a an obligation to actually know what youre doing for that job and right now I feel like I know what Im doing. At least a lot more so than I did last year or even last semester so at the rate Im going I feel like you know another semester of classes that Im taking Ill really know what Im doing and then some more time in the field or at the job itll piece together and Ill actually feel pretty confident. So thats... ... Thats why I guess.

68,68,p89, Um so Im a junior at MIT here and um Im a physics major and I uh yeah besides classes Im involved in the juggling club and uh lets see and Im from Pensacola Florida and Ive lived there uh ever since I I was born there grew up there and I um yeah lived there and moved up here. Yeah Im in Zeta Psy fraternity and uh yeah so yeah right above Chicago Pizza. And uh yeah do you want me to go into more detail or just general? Yeah um yeah so I uh I dont too much as far as extra-curricular but I was involved with Frisbee freshman year for a little bit and played the club team theres not a varsity team here. I was pretty good liked that a lot. And uh Im not sure as far as career wise what I want to go into but as a physics major Im looking into something technical probably electrical engineering related. Uh and yeah but Im trying to size that up right now. Juniors a pretty pivotal year for you know deciding long term things. Yeah so brief summary of me. Um well high school uh senior year probably the best time. I helped organize a math competition um so there was no major middle school math competition in Pensacola Florida and so I just teamed up with a few people with my year in high school and we helped organize a competition. Its been going on for the past three years and uh hopefully itll go further. That was one of the most stressful things but the most rewarding as well and yeah so as far as leadership goes. I mean more recently I guess juggling club has been my main leadership thing we organize different gigs and perform various places so. Um so that would most commonly have been this past semester I took junior lab which is the physics lab class. Lots of challenges frequently. It was me and a partner who worked on three different experiments and um specifically I guess let me think because yeah we had three major experiments and the second experiment was very hands on which was cool but it also means there was a lot of faulty equipment. I guess just a general thing we both learned to kind of talk it through because its so easy to I dont know get like get in your head and youre working with somebody so theyll be thinking one thing and youll be thinking another. Yeah I guess thats not very specific but I mean yeah thats the first thing that came to mind so.re doing to overcome it? Yeah weakness? I guess I uh as far as this is kind of a general thing that Ive kind of come to the realization of recently. I need to um I dont know Ive been kind of getting along with my undergraduate career and you know what Ill do after. Self-advocacy is like a huge thing and I havent really gotten too much into that but I feel like a major thing for like taking the next step like after graduation is like self-advocacy. Whether its like having your own website or just like general networking. I dont know thats something that I realize that I need to kind of work on.d like to have. Okay do you have one in mind? Um yeah. Why do I think I should have this job? Um I feel like Im a pretty creative person and you know having a bit of technical background here and a good work ethic I feel like I really do have those strengths. Yeah I feel like I communicate pretty well for um Im not saying you know general physics majors cant communicate well just in general I feel like especially this past semester Ive taken a lab classes Ive been able to give a lot of oral presentations and um I kind of found a strength there and so I think kind of bringing a solid communication element to a technical field is pretty important. So um yeah I feel Im pretty qualified there.,"[' Um so Im a junior at MIT here and um Im a physics major and I uh yeah besides classes Im involved in the juggling club and uh lets see and Im from Pensacola Florida and Ive lived there uh ever since I I was born there grew up there and I um yeah lived there and moved up here.', 'Yeah Im in Zeta Psy fraternity and uh yeah so yeah right above Chicago Pizza.', 'And uh yeah do you want me to go into more detail or just general?', 'Yeah um yeah so I uh I dont too much as far as extra-curricular but I was involved with Frisbee freshman year for a little bit and played the club team theres not a varsity team here.', 'I was pretty good liked that a lot.', 'And uh Im not sure as far as career wise what I want to go into but as a physics major Im looking into something technical probably electrical engineering related.', 'Uh and yeah but Im trying to size that up right now.', 'Juniors a pretty pivotal year for you know deciding long term things.', 'Yeah so brief summary of me.', 'Um well high school uh senior year probably the best time.', 'I helped organize a math competition um so there was no major middle school math competition in Pensacola Florida and so I just teamed up with a few people with my year in high school and we helped organize a competition.', 'Its been going on for the past three years and uh hopefully itll go further.', 'That was one of the most stressful things but the most rewarding as well and yeah so as far as leadership goes.', 'I mean more recently I guess juggling club has been my main leadership thing we organize different gigs and perform various places so.', 'Um so that would most commonly have been this past semester I took junior lab which is the physics lab class.', 'Lots of challenges frequently.', 'It was me and a partner who worked on three different experiments and um specifically I guess let me think because yeah we had three major experiments and the second experiment was very hands on which was cool but it also means there was a lot of faulty equipment.', 'I guess just a general thing we both learned to kind of talk it through because its so easy to I dont know get like get in your head and youre working with somebody so theyll be thinking one thing and youll be thinking another.', 'Yeah I guess thats not very specific but I mean yeah thats the first thing that came to mind so.re doing to overcome it?', 'Yeah weakness?', 'I guess I uh as far as this is kind of a general thing that Ive kind of come to the realization of recently.', 'I need to um I dont know Ive been kind of getting along with my undergraduate career and you know what Ill do after.', 'Self-advocacy is like a huge thing and I havent really gotten too much into that but I feel like a major thing for like taking the next step like after graduation is like self-advocacy.', 'Whether its like having your own website or just like general networking.', 'I dont know thats something that I realize that I need to kind of work on.d like to have.', 'Okay do you have one in mind?', 'Um yeah.', 'Why do I think I should have this job?', 'Um I feel like Im a pretty creative person and you know having a bit of technical background here and a good work ethic I feel like I really do have those strengths.', 'Yeah I feel like I communicate pretty well for um Im not saying you know general physics majors cant communicate well just in general I feel like especially this past semester Ive taken a lab classes Ive been able to give a lot of oral presentations and um I kind of found a strength there and so I think kind of bringing a solid communication element to a technical field is pretty important.', 'So um yeah I feel Im pretty qualified there.']","[array([0.01508745, 0.00913897, 0.9242256 , 0.00141596, 0.05013194],

69,69,pp1, Umm so Im a computer science and biology major here at MIT. Im a junior and Im expecting to graduate in June 2014. Ahm Im interested in kinda doing both research and as well as practical application of some type of biological research with computational engineering involved. Sorry would you like to know more or is that alright?m more interested in how long you can talk as long as you like. For instance if you turn these around 180 thats one of the reasons giving you a funny look. Do you think youre a leader? Tell me why. Uhm I do I would say that when situations present themselves I step up to the occasion. Im not afraid to take the lead on a project or like. For example I guess um for one of my computer science projects that we were working on a group together one of our teammates wasnt working well I wasnt afraid to kind of step up and take the lead and be like “hey we gotta get this done.” And um its kind of happened multiple times before I guess. s a conflict on your team and you had to resolve it. Um so one of the other organizations I do is Camp Kesem and Im actually on their exec board. And so a lot of what we do is we plan out the summer camp for our kids whose parents have cancer. And a lot of times were just debating simply like how exactly we want to get uh or how we want the whole camp to you know uh kinda go day by day we need plan out the whole schedule. So we have a lot of conflict because everyone has all these different ideas and this is a very team oriented board and although its got the normal hierarchal structure uh we do a lot of things like just simply by like mapping them out on the board and visualizing the day and schedules and planning between us and what the teens have to do where were able to come up with a solution together. So I would say that its a good example of me being one of a team and coming up with a solution together. Um I think Id like to be more interested in academia and even research. Uh I enjoy what I do but Ive seen some awesome things that you can do if you-I dont fault them for pursing a career in peer research which is why I think its kind of interesting why Id admire myself more if I were more interested in that field but - Ah I think Im qualified and I think Ill bring a lot to the company I-I fit in well with the environment here.

70,70,pp10,	So tell me about your background. 	Um so um Im a third-year student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology uh my major is aerospace engineering; and I um… my my background is primarily in fluid mechanics and control and so thats why Im interviewing for this position. Um and um the applications Im primarily interested in are in rotorcraft uh design and uh analysis. And uh um and Im really excited about what your company is doing.	Excellent. So do you think youre a leader? Tell me why. 	Um so yes. I think I I think that I… I dont think that a leader is the first adjective Id pull out to describe myself. Um but I think its something that I definitely a role I definitely step into um when when the need arises or when um I think that its appropriate. Um whether I seek that out I think really depends on the context but um I definitely see myself as someone who can act independently uh can make decisions independently can act on those decisions and uh can manage people in order um to get sort of positive results. 	Do you think of yourself as a team player? Can you give me an example where there was a conflict on your team and you had to resolve it? 	Mm-hmm. OK um so um… so when I worked for um the computer science and artificial intelligence lab in freshman year I um had had an issue um with one of the students I was working with um um and we had a disagreement about how to handle some part of the project. Um it was it was more of a mechanical issue about what direction we should take um and without getting too into details I think um going back to the leadership issue um the way I the way I handled this issue was um to sit down and address the issue very directly um and to have a frank conversation about what we both wanted evaluate where we both were and uh talk through the options and make a decision right there. Not letting an issue linger; um I think thats generally my style. 	That makes a lot of sense. So uh if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself what would that be? 	Um thats not a question Ive been asked a lot. I think there are a few things. Um one that comes to mind immediately is my written communication skills. Um I definitely know thats something that I need to work on and um would love the opportunity to improve on that.	Why do you think you should get the job? 	So from what Ive seen so far in the interview and visiting um Im really excited about this position I think this is somewhere I would fit where I would fit in a lot. Um Im really excited about what I would be doing and the people I would be working with and um I would just love to sort of get my hands dirty. And um I think Im pretty well-equipped to do so and to contribute in doing so. Um so Id love that opportunity.	Well thank you. 	Yeah. Thank you.	I appreciate your time interviewing the…,"['\tSo tell me about your background.', 'Um so um Im a third-year student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology uh my major is aerospace engineering; and I um… my my background is primarily in fluid mechanics and control and so thats why Im interviewing for this position.', 'Um and um the applications Im primarily interested in are in rotorcraft uh design and uh analysis.', 'And uh um and Im really excited about what your company is doing.', 'Excellent.', 'So do you think youre a leader?', 'Tell me why.', 'Um so yes.', 'I think I I think that I… I dont think that a leader is the first adjective Id pull out to describe myself.', 'Um but I think its something that I definitely a role I definitely step into um when when the need arises or when um I think that its appropriate.', 'Um whether I seek that out I think really depends on the context but um I definitely see myself as someone who can act independently uh can make decisions independently can act on those decisions and uh can manage people in order um to get sort of positive results.', 'Do you think of yourself as a team player?', 'Can you give me an example where there was a conflict on your team and you had to resolve it?', 'Mm-hmm.', 'OK um so um… so when I worked for um the computer science and artificial intelligence lab in freshman year I um had had an issue um with one of the students I was working with um um and we had a disagreement about how to handle some part of the project.', 'Um it was it was more of a mechanical issue about what direction we should take um and without getting too into details I think um going back to the leadership issue um the way I the way I handled this issue was um to sit down and address the issue very directly um and to have a frank conversation about what we both wanted evaluate where we both were and uh talk through the options and make a decision right there.', 'Not letting an issue linger; um I think thats generally my style.', 'That makes a lot of sense.', 'So uh if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself what would that be?', 'Um thats not a question Ive been asked a lot.', 'I think there are a few things.', 'Um one that comes to mind immediately is my written communication skills.', 'Um I definitely know thats something that I need to work on and um would love the opportunity to improve on that.', 'Why do you think you should get the job?', 'So from what Ive seen so far in the interview and visiting um Im really excited about this position I think this is somewhere I would fit where I would fit in a lot.', 'Um Im really excited about what I would be doing and the people I would be working with and um I would just love to sort of get my hands dirty.', 'And um I think Im pretty well-equipped to do so and to contribute in doing so.', 'Um so Id love that opportunity.', 'Well thank you.', 'Yeah.', 'Thank you.', 'I appreciate your time interviewing the…']","[array([8.7790877e-02, 1.9309528e-02, 7.6910731e-04, 3.4896866e-03,

72,72,pp12, Yea so Im a member clinical engineering student at MIT Im a Junior um my main focus is in robotics and product design so Im real interested in personal robotics and robotic side helps people on a daily basis.

73,73,pp13, Um Im a junior at MIT studying electrical engineering and computer science.Um I first became interested in engineering in high school when I did a summer internship at a lab at materials science lab at UC Berkley and since then Ive taken uh several courses related to circuits and other eletrical engineering topics. And worked at uh electrical engineering labs at Standford and MIT. And Ive also worked in places like Promex Industries which is a chip packaging company in the Silicon Valley. Uh yes. Ive had several experiences where Ive had to innovate and work with take charge of a project and work with other people. For instance Im part of the MIT SAE team and basically its a club that builds a race car every year. Um and as of so we need a lot of money for sponsorship. But as of the end of last year the website was pretty much defunct. So I decided to take over as webmaster and one of my and over the summer and the beginning of the school year. I set up a new one thats nicely designed and to get it up I had to work with most of the other sub-team leaders to get information that I needed. For instance the specs of the car pictures of the car different events for PR and things like that. And its done now so its online now. Um. So. Ah yes because. Uh for instance Im also on the (inaudible). And um while I was working on designing the website I talked to several other people including the public relations chair about how to design and present ourselves on the website. And we disagreed about certain uh about the layout and things like that. So to resolve the issue we basically looked at websites of several other successful teams and tried to we basically both compromised to try to emulate things that seemed to work well for other people. And we also got opinions from several other team members. Um one thing right now is that I get hung up on small details on a project. And that could be an issue when Im working on a big project it can take too much time to focus on little things that dont matter too much in the big picture. But Im working on changing that so since Ive come to MIT Ive been involved in a lot of activities and a lot of classes and this is forcing me to manage my time well so Ive gotten better at focusing on the big picture of the project rather than small details that dont matter very much. I have the quantitative and qualitative skills to solve problems and get things done and Im really interested in this position and I think I can learn and grow from it.,"[' Um Im a junior at MIT studying electrical engineering and computer science.Um I first became interested in engineering in high school when I did a summer internship at a lab at materials science lab at UC Berkley and since then Ive taken uh several courses related to circuits and other eletrical engineering topics.', 'And worked at uh electrical engineering labs at Standford and MIT.', 'And Ive also worked in places like Promex Industries which is a chip packaging company in the Silicon Valley.', 'Uh yes.', 'Ive had several experiences where Ive had to innovate and work with take charge of a project and work with other people.', 'For instance Im part of the MIT SAE team and basically its a club that builds a race car every year.', 'Um and as of so we need a lot of money for sponsorship.', 'But as of the end of last year the website was pretty much defunct.', 'So I decided to take over as webmaster and one of my and over the summer and the beginning of the school year.', 'I set up a new one thats nicely designed and to get it up I had to work with most of the other sub-team leaders to get information that I needed.', 'For instance the specs of the car pictures of the car different events for PR and things like that.', 'And its done now so its online now.', 'Um.', 'So.', 'Ah yes because.', 'Uh for instance Im also on the (inaudible).', 'And um while I was working on designing the website I talked to several other people including the public relations chair about how to design and present ourselves on the website.', 'And we disagreed about certain uh about the layout and things like that.', 'So to resolve the issue we basically looked at websites of several other successful teams and tried to we basically both compromised to try to emulate things that seemed to work well for other people.', 'And we also got opinions from several other team members.', 'Um one thing right now is that I get hung up on small details on a project.', 'And that could be an issue when Im working on a big project it can take too much time to focus on little things that dont matter too much in the big picture.', 'But Im working on changing that so since Ive come to MIT Ive been involved in a lot of activities and a lot of classes and this is forcing me to manage my time well so Ive gotten better at focusing on the big picture of the project rather than small details that dont matter very much.', 'I have the quantitative and qualitative skills to solve problems and get things done and Im really interested in this position and I think I can learn and grow from it.']","[array([0.02074024, 0.00668583, 0.94541323, 0.00096453, 0.02619627],

74,74,pp14, Sure. Uh. Im a computer science student here and Im currently a junior but Im planning on graduating early. So uhm Im right now looking into either getting my masters degree or looking at full time jobs as well and balancing that. Uh in terms of what I enjoy in computer science I really like front end stuff. Ive done a lot of web development. I worked at Google last Summer On Google+ photos the front end for that. And uh yeah. So I really like eh c-consumer facing products. Uh well I think I have a pretty engaging personality. So Im very expressive and Im good at communicating things. So I think yknow just that qualification in itself really lends m- my uh myself to leadership. But I think also uh as a technical person its its e- especially useful to have those skills because they are more rare. So in that sense I do think Im a leader because I possess both you know technical skills and then also the ability to communicate really well. So the pairing of that really does lend itself well to leadership roles. Sure. So eh whats so great about MIT is that we actually do a lot of group projects that really encourage teamwork. So you know a lot of the issues that maybe I didnt work out in high school in terms of working on a team Ive gotten the chance to flesh out here and I do think that Ive been able to grow uhm as someone working on a team. So for example in one of my classes its a software design class and we basically had to split up the work so that we could get this huge project done. And one of the people on my team was just really not pulling her weight. And so me and this other person noticed this and we were concerned. But we all discussed it. We sat down and discussed it and we realized just that the way we were allocating the work wasnt playing to her strengths. So we adjusted how we were allocating the work and then things worked out a lot better. We were able to you know accomplish our goals and also more evenly divide the- the work. Uhm thats a hard question. Haha! Cuz Im a pretty confident person so theres not a lot of things. I dont often think about this. I guess... ... I wish that uhm... ... I wish I had the ability to uh I guess stop and enjoy the moment a little bit more. I think because I am very ambitious and I really enjoy life Im always going and moving and doing things and I think theres times where it is better to just relax and enjoy whatevers happening in your life. Uh but you know Im young so I like to try a lot of new things. And thats a consequence of that. : Mhmm. Uh so I mentioned this before but I think Im qualified in a lot of respects both technically and in my communication skills. So thats just a balance that you dont see a lot uh especially in the computer science field. So I think I can bring a lot to the table in terms of that uh in terms of just leadership skills and my ability to talk to people but also my ability to understand uh technical concepts. And especially working in a technical company thats incredibly important. So I think I have a good balance of that and youre not going to find a lot of candidates like that.,"[' Sure.', 'Uh.', 'Im a computer science student here and Im currently a junior but Im planning on graduating early.', 'So uhm Im right now looking into either getting my masters degree or looking at full time jobs as well and balancing that.', 'Uh in terms of what I enjoy in computer science I really like front end stuff.', 'Ive done a lot of web development.', 'I worked at Google last Summer On Google+ photos the front end for that.', 'And uh yeah.', 'So I really like eh c-consumer facing products.', 'Uh well I think I have a pretty engaging personality.', 'So Im very expressive and Im good at communicating things.', 'So I think yknow just that qualification in itself really lends m- my uh myself to leadership.', 'But I think also uh as a technical person its its e- especially useful to have those skills because they are more rare.', 'So in that sense I do think Im a leader because I possess both you know technical skills and then also the ability to communicate really well.', 'So the pairing of that really does lend itself well to leadership roles.', 'Sure.', 'So eh whats so great about MIT is that we actually do a lot of group projects that really encourage teamwork.', 'So you know a lot of the issues that maybe I didnt work out in high school in terms of working on a team Ive gotten the chance to flesh out here and I do think that Ive been able to grow uhm as someone working on a team.', 'So for example in one of my classes its a software design class and we basically had to split up the work so that we could get this huge project done.', 'And one of the people on my team was just really not pulling her weight.', 'And so me and this other person noticed this and we were concerned.', 'But we all discussed it.', 'We sat down and discussed it and we realized just that the way we were allocating the work wasnt playing to her strengths.', 'So we adjusted how we were allocating the work and then things worked out a lot better.', 'We were able to you know accomplish our goals and also more evenly divide the- the work.', 'Uhm thats a hard question.', 'Haha!', 'Cuz Im a pretty confident person so theres not a lot of things.', 'I dont often think about this.', 'I guess... ...', 'I wish that uhm... ...', 'I wish I had the ability to uh I guess stop and enjoy the moment a little bit more.', 'I think because I am very ambitious and I really enjoy life Im always going and moving and doing things and I think theres times where it is better to just relax and enjoy whatevers happening in your life.', 'Uh but you know Im young so I like to try a lot of new things.', 'And thats a consequence of that.', ': Mhmm.', 'Uh so I mentioned this before but I think Im qualified in a lot of respects both technically and in my communication skills.', 'So thats just a balance that you dont see a lot uh especially in the computer science field.', 'So I think I can bring a lot to the table in terms of that uh in terms of just leadership skills and my ability to talk to people but also my ability to understand uh technical concepts.', 'And especially working in a technical company thats incredibly important.', 'So I think I have a good balance of that and youre not going to find a lot of candidates like that.']","[array([1.8167980e-02, 1.0458019e-03, 6.0523226e-04, 8.5780490e-04,

75,75,pp15, More about my background? Uh are we assuming that-- Okay. Okay. Um all right. Um so I guess Ill start out with uh I decided to go to MIT as my undergrad school. -hm. Because I wanted a strong education in science and math. And um MIT I found would be one of the best places to develop my problem-solving skills and my uh quant--my quantitative skills which is really valuable I feel um for employers nowadays and so I can certainly say that [laugh] its I have definitely got a lot better at like learning how to solve problems working with others um and its also given me like a lot of opportunity MIT has given me a lot of opportunity to you know test out my leadership skills by having so many different student groups. -hm. Um in particular um Ive like I feel that um my position as the 2014 treasurer my freshman year was uh really critical in helping me develop um you know time management skills interpersonal skills---hm. --and communicating with like not only your like not only with like um people who are at you know adults who are older than you and working with people in different offices but also with like your peers.-hm. Um similarly um in training students club Ive found um that where Ive taken a leadership role as a cultural chair that unlike in say high school you need to really spearhead um efforts to like throw large events yourself and thats like its really given me um a feel of what its like to sort of you know take on the responsibility of like organizing an event. Mm-hm. Um I think I def-- um. Im sorry. I think that I am definitely a leader.

Mm-hm. Okay. Um I think probably the best example um I definitely consider myself a team player. I had to work in teams--in everything Ive had to do so far from academics to my work experience. Um in my start-up internship my freshman year um and my corporate internship my sophomore year. Um everything was I had to learn how to um not only do the task that was given to me but to also sort of be able to you know delegate tasks to who I was working with and carry out what was what was asked of me as well. Um last summer I was a year um I did an international year off in Thailand and my lab partner um was a graduate student who was older than me but I was we were partners on the project---hm. --but we found that our levels of technical skill were really different. It was her first time working in any sort of lab-- --whereas I was more experienced. So that sort of created a strange dynamic between us um because I had to like take the lead even though she was given more responsibility because more was expected from her so I had to sort of help her out and get her up to speed with with the project. Um and I needed to do that in a way that didnt hurt our personal relationship-- --because we also did have to like live together. -hm. Being Americans abroad we really stayed together for most of it so I felt that being just like really honest and transparent with her was um the best way um just to like say what about you know say you know just like speak up about our frustrations but also like to to compliment on like the things that are done well. I think thats what really helped. Um so one thing I wish I was better at was um you know speaking well when put on the spot. [Laugh] I tend to when Im nervous I tend to you know not really focus on what Im saying because Im trying not to mess up---hm. --and in order to hide that I also you know channel the stress in different ways such as like looking around perhaps a lot of intrusive movement with my hands or my body um and also speaking being long-winded and speaking too much in order to cover that up. So I think that just being more comfortable with speaking um in the higher pressure situation such as public speaking or in an interview! [Laughs][Laughs] Um is something that I would like to improve. Okay. Um so I think that I can bring like with the the my skills and experience is um someone who is really can work well under stress. I may not talk well under stress-- [laughs][Laughs] --but I can work well under stress. Um I think my academic being um you know having the rigorous undergraduate curriculum at MIT has made me really hone my time management skills. Um the other week I had to juggle um um you know throwing together a large event for a students club um and have meetings with cultural chairs of the other clubs. Um Ive also had to at the same time there was a big event that my sorority was organizing that I also have to help contribute to. -hm. And like uh my I had a friend whos also going through a tough time so I had to like help her out. That and then complete school work. And also um you know just keep on the lookout now that Im a junior theres a lot of like you know opportunities and needs such as like fellowships and then like programs of like IP over the summer that have like application deadlines coming up---hm. --and just being able to balance all of that.

76,76,pp16, Umm so Im a Junior at MIT umm studying economics umm and planning on minoring in biology perhaps concentrating in anthropology. Umm Im interested in pursuing a degree in Public Health after right after MIT umm and either waiting to do an MD or combining those two at the same time. Umm what Im really interested is health care disparities umm especially in in the field of international health umm specifically kind of doing uh cost evaluation of different health projects umm working towards uh figuring out how resources can best be allocated and best be used to maximize efficiency. Umm and then here at MIT Im also involved in an organization called Glommid umm and we what we do is were partnered with an organization in Togo umm and they work with HIV/AIDS patients there and they are the primary HIV/AID care provider umm outside of the public health system there. Umm and so what we do is we fundraise for them throughout the year and then in the summer we go and implement a project there. Umm I think that definitely over the MIT my MIT career Ive evolved more as a leader. Umm of the umm actually the co-president of Glommid umm last year so the club started last year uh but the presidents were not very invested in the club umm and what I learned from that was I guess the experience was taught me some things what leaders shouldnt be but I think really Ive learned whats effective as a leader so far by doing things differently this semester. Um some of the things like even just the really little basic things seem to really have an impact so for example for our staff meetings which is the whole general body meeting umm were sending we send out a little doodle form beforehand and it kinda just has you know what concerns do you have umm do you feel like youre really involved like umm and theres also just a little section like kudos to someone for doing a great job this week. And just having that like interaction and then also we like follow up on any concerns umm I think the members really have liked that and so far compared to last year everyone like even the people who are just general body members not even like an exec are much more invested than some of the exec members last year and I think thats because we realized last year what we really were lacking umm like my current co-president realized that what we were lacking was really a sense of community and in order to be effective and to really establish a strong relationship with our partner and to fundraise and really come up with a strong project we need to focus within ourselves first. Umm so that experience definitely has taught me a lot about leadership. Umm yea ok. So conflict. Umm well i guess Ill use an example from last year for Glommid. Umm so we were partnered with a different organization last year and we what how it works is a national organization theres fifty chapters umm and we had a partner in Laos and all of a sudden last minute they said we could no longer go and implement the project. So I was the person in charge of organizing the trip that my role on exec so that was really hard for me because I felt kind of betrayed kind of by the co-presidents and by nationals umm because the reason was because the Laotian government would see us volunteer tourism and they could get their NGO status revoked since Laos just started having NGOs. So that was something I kind of was unsure about like are we sure we can go here like Laos is very not welcoming towards Americans because of past. And so I felt really kind of let down by umm by them. And I think everyone on the Glommid team also felt really let down because it was February we had been fundraising all year planning campaigns umm and this so what we did I think umm like I switched over to campaigns coordinator and I still like tried to keep everyone invested and excited for our campaign to still fundraise for them because it wasnt because they were a bad organization that we couldnt go it was because that the government wouldnt allow it and we didnt want to risk them losing their NGO status for a project. Umm so what I went through the campaign I tried to get people to focus more just remember what our partner does why we are doing this umm and not focus so much on kind of the miscommunication that happened between nationals and the partner organization. Umm and then through this summer and through this fall ive been trying to keep in contact with our partner our old partner although we are repartnered now umm to see how our the money we raised like how that project is going and to try and keep people informed about whats going on so that it doesnt feel like last year was a complete failure. Yea. Oh thats a tough question. Umm I think sometimes i can lack a bit of confidence in bigger group settings. Umm and it usually takes me a little bit to get comfortable with the situation so I think Ive definitely and this is something ive been working on to be more proactive and in larger group situations but for example like big lectures asking questions or things like that I usually try and avoid but Ive been trying to push myself to become more vocal. Uh I think I should get the job because I think what my assets are I combine Econ and health which is kind of rare to have as an undergraduate to have this combination. And Ive done Ive taken a lot of classes Im involved in a national development both from the technical side of Econ the anthropological and the health side. And also my involvement in Glommid has also taught me a lot about the realities of international health and international development that I dont think necessarily come through a class.,"[' Umm so Im a Junior at MIT umm studying economics umm and planning on minoring in biology perhaps concentrating in anthropology.', 'Umm Im interested in pursuing a degree in Public Health after right after MIT umm and either waiting to do an MD or combining those two at the same time.', 'Umm what Im really interested is health care disparities umm especially in in the field of international health umm specifically kind of doing uh cost evaluation of different health projects umm working towards uh figuring out how resources can best be allocated and best be used to maximize efficiency.', 'Umm and then here at MIT Im also involved in an organization called Glommid umm and we what we do is were partnered with an organization in Togo umm and they work with HIV/AIDS patients there and they are the primary HIV/AID care provider umm outside of the public health system there.', 'Umm and so what we do is we fundraise for them throughout the year and then in the summer we go and implement a project there.', 'Umm I think that definitely over the MIT my MIT career Ive evolved more as a leader.', 'Umm of the umm actually the co-president of Glommid umm last year so the club started last year uh but the presidents were not very invested in the club umm and what I learned from that was I guess the experience was taught me some things what leaders shouldnt be but I think really Ive learned whats effective as a leader so far by doing things differently this semester.', 'Um some of the things like even just the really little basic things seem to really have an impact so for example for our staff meetings which is the whole general body meeting umm were sending we send out a little doodle form beforehand and it kinda just has you know what concerns do you have umm do you feel like youre really involved like umm and theres also just a little section like kudos to someone for doing a great job this week.', 'And just having that like interaction and then also we like follow up on any concerns umm I think the members really have liked that and so far compared to last year everyone like even the people who are just general body members not even like an exec are much more invested than some of the exec members last year and I think thats because we realized last year what we really were lacking umm like my current co-president realized that what we were lacking was really a sense of community and in order to be effective and to really establish a strong relationship with our partner and to fundraise and really come up with a strong project we need to focus within ourselves first.', 'Umm so that experience definitely has taught me a lot about leadership.', 'Umm yea ok.', 'So conflict.', 'Umm well i guess Ill use an example from last year for Glommid.', 'Umm so we were partnered with a different organization last year and we what how it works is a national organization theres fifty chapters umm and we had a partner in Laos and all of a sudden last minute they said we could no longer go and implement the project.', 'So I was the person in charge of organizing the trip that my role on exec so that was really hard for me because I felt kind of betrayed kind of by the co-presidents and by nationals umm because the reason was because the Laotian government would see us volunteer tourism and they could get their NGO status revoked since Laos just started having NGOs.', 'So that was something I kind of was unsure about like are we sure we can go here like Laos is very not welcoming towards Americans because of past.', 'And so I felt really kind of let down by umm by them.', 'And I think everyone on the Glommid team also felt really let down because it was February we had been fundraising all year planning campaigns umm and this so what we did I think umm like I switched over to campaigns coordinator and I still like tried to keep everyone invested and excited for our campaign to still fundraise for them because it wasnt because they were a bad organization that we couldnt go it was because that the government wouldnt allow it and we didnt want to risk them losing their NGO status for a project.', 'Umm so what I went through the campaign I tried to get people to focus more just remember what our partner does why we are doing this umm and not focus so much on kind of the miscommunication that happened between nationals and the partner organization.', 'Umm and then through this summer and through this fall ive been trying to keep in contact with our partner our old partner although we are repartnered now umm to see how our the money we raised like how that project is going and to try and keep people informed about whats going on so that it doesnt feel like last year was a complete failure.', 'Yea.', 'Oh thats a tough question.', 'Umm I think sometimes i can lack a bit of confidence in bigger group settings.', 'Umm and it usually takes me a little bit to get comfortable with the situation so I think Ive definitely and this is something ive been working on to be more proactive and in larger group situations but for example like big lectures asking questions or things like that I usually try and avoid but Ive been trying to push myself to become more vocal.', 'Uh I think I should get the job because I think what my assets are I combine Econ and health which is kind of rare to have as an undergraduate to have this combination.', 'And Ive done Ive taken a lot of classes Im involved in a national development both from the technical side of Econ the anthropological and the health side.', 'And also my involvement in Glommid has also taught me a lot about the realities of international health and international development that I dont think necessarily come through a class.']","[array([6.6233268e-03,

77,77,pp17, Been all right. Schools uh you know its always that time in the middle of the semester. Yeah its nuts. Um yes so I am a junior here at MIT in Computer Science and Engineering um and most of my experience here has been actually at the Game Lab on campus so Ive worked there for the past few years and Ive worked on many different kinds of projects in various languages and with different people. Um and uh also uh Ive taken courses here in algorithms uh in graphics uh also software construction. But Ive really found algorithms to be something that Im really interested in I think theyre really beautiful and elegant they can accomplish a lot. And in my spare time I like to um do yoga Im not very good at it and I love food so finding hidden gems in the city is really fun.re a leader? Tell me why. Uh yes I am. So um last semester here at MIT I took as I mentioned a software construction class and um in this class we had you know quite a few projects and some of these were group projects. So the first group project that we had in the class um I was working with uh two of my peers. They seemed um like nice people and all but we were having issues um you know actually getting things done. Getting a time when we could all meet and um you know that sort of thing. So uh it looked like no one was really stepping up so I decided to step up and um I made sure to contact everyone in the group and um you know got us working together um and we met up. And you know I made sure that we were always on task and took notes on what we were doing um so that when it came to actually implementing our ideas that we actually had some sort of structure and our project turned out really great uh at the end. There was a bit of a time crunch but all in all I think we worked together really well and Im very pleased with how it turned out. I do consider myself a team player. Um worked on many teams. So in this same software construction class ironically the second group project which was our final project for the course did not go quite as planned. So I was working with two other people and uh in this case I tried to get us working together and tried to do my part for our project but uh they were not having it and um they actually ended up overwriting my code multiple times instead of you know allowing me to contribute to the project um even after I spoke to them about it and told them there were tools um that could help resolve conflicts in the code and they just werent cooperating. Um and so I ended up having to go talk to my TA and talking to my course administrator here and also to the student support services to see you know what how I could resolves the situation because I had done everything that I thought I could. Um so that turned out okay at the end but sometimes things are out of your control and I think those are the hardest problems to confront but um you know uh its okay to ask for help sometimes I think that it ended up okay in the end. Ooh thats a toughie. Hmm I think if I had one thing I could change it would probably be being more aggressive which aggressive is a scary word perhaps so um perhaps being more assertive. Ive always been a pretty quiet person um even when I was growing up and this is something that like in elementary school my teachers would say that “Oh” you know on my progress reports “[Stephie?] Is a very quiet and sweet girl” but they didnt really have anything else to say because I was so quiet. Um and you know even now sometimes being around people can make me nervous and this is something that Ive been working on um you know over you know since I can remember I guess. And as of late Ive been trying to take a more active role in you know overcoming my fear of people. Uh I uh a few years ago worked at a Starbucks for about a year. Yeah back in this was in downtown Boston in the financial district so of all the customers you could possibly have at a Starbucks these were the probably the most challenging ones that you could have. So after working there and dealing with these people I feel like I can pretty much you know I can deal with anyone even if it makes me sort of nervous. Um you know Ive been there so I can sort of take my experiences form there and apply them to what I encounter nowadays. Hm well uh I have a lot of experience uh working at the Game Lab here and that coupled with you know what Ive learned in classes I think makes me a really good fit for this job. I have um so when I was working at the Game Lab I worked on many many projects so pretty much one project a semester and these projects varied widely. They were in different languages the topics were different. Some were more technical some werent. Some were more fully specified than others. And so given that Ive touched upon such a wide range of things I think that Im very adaptable. Uh and also um at this Game Lab Ive worked in lots of teams so I feel like I have a strong grasp of teamwork and having worked at that Starbucks Ive really learned to deal with all sorts of people so I feel like thats a good asset to have for this job.,"[' Been all right.', 'Schools uh you know its always that time in the middle of the semester.', 'Yeah its nuts.', 'Um yes so I am a junior here at

80,80,pp22, Im a Junior in Aerospace Engineering. Im originally from Kansas City born in Maryland. And Im interested in consulting because Im currently trying to decide between going into Aerospace Engineering and going into consulting. And one of the things that appeals to me about consulting is that I like the idea of working on different projects and not being stuck doing the same thing all the time and thats something that is very prevalent in engineering and is very traditional about the engineering field. And as far as hobbies that I enjoy I am interested in global development international development and poverty related issues as well as music. I play cello and am involved with the chamber music society at MIT. Yes I definitely do think Im a leader. Um one of the global poverty - er - one of the organizations Im involved with on campus is the Global Poverty Initiative and Im currently their Director of Action. And what that means is Im leading a student group of about twenty people and - um - under the Action branch of the whole organization - and what we do is - in the Action branch - is work on projects on a global scale. So we have projects currently in India and projects in mexico. And my job is to coordinate these projects and work on what communities we want to go work in and what types of technology related projects wed like to pursue. And Ive been involved with this organization for two and a half years now and have been the director of Action for the past two years. I definitely do consider myself a team player. Um one time that we experienced some conflict in one of the teams I was working on was actually in one of my Aerospace Engineering classes. In this team our job was to build an RC airplane - design build and fly it. And we hit some conflicts within our team because - it was mostly everyone was very busy everyone was very stressed. It was towards the end of the year when everyones preparing for finals and it was just a very high-strung environment and the projects was very involved. It involved machining it involved design work and coordination between a team of four. And what ended up happening was well we needed to get in and find the time to actually work on our airplane and build it. Whereas all of us were involved in student groups and had a very heavy courseload. And conflict did arise. And how we ended up solving this was we - we all decided that something needed to change. And we realized that we werent putting together quality work when we were doing two people at a time or two people coming in or someone cancelling at the last minute - things like that. We ended up just having to sit down lay it all out discuss whatever we needed to do to make sure that were all here - were all committing the right amount of time towards this project. And honestly it was just very much a group effort and we all sat down and individually realized that we needed to prioritize. And I needed to put my classes above some of my interests and my hobbies. And that was something that we all decided to do as a group. One thing about myself... being more on top of my work. Something that I definitely need for myself is a deadline and Ive always been like that. If you dont give me a deadline sometimes Ill end up dragging my feet and things get done at the last minute and its just... disorganization. And so Ive been trying to deal with that by making my own small deadlines - personal deadlines - writing them down making lists and making sure that I prioritize things in advance. But thats something that has taken me probably two years at MIT to learn how to do - and Im finally getting it. I think I should get the job because I have a very interesting background and I believe that I have very unique experiences that could add a lot to your organization. As someone with an engineering background but - as well as a management background because I am minoring in management at MIT. And I think that combination adds a lot to the environment that you would like to have at your company. I think putting a lot of people together in one environment trying to work on the same projects with the same background is something that is very limiting. And I believe that I could add quite a bit of diversity and unique perspective to your team.,"[' Im a Junior in Aerospace Engineering.', 'Im originally from Kansas City born in Maryland.', 'And Im interested in consulting because Im currently trying to decide between going into Aerospace Engineering and going into consulting.', 'And one of the things that appeals to me about consulting is that I like the idea of working on different projects and not being stuck doing the same thing all the time and thats something that is very prevalent in engineering and is very traditional about the engineering field.', 'And as far as hobbies that I enjoy I am interested in global development international development and poverty related issues as well as music.', 'I play cello and am involved with the chamber music society at MIT.', 'Yes I definitely do think Im a leader.', 'Um one of the global poverty - er - one of the organizations Im involved with on campus is the Global Poverty Initiative and Im currently their Director of Action.', 'And what that means is Im leading a student group of about twenty people and - um - under the Action branch of the whole organization - and what we do is - in the Action branch - is work on projects on a global scale.', 'So we have projects currently in India and projects in mexico.', 'And my job is to coordinate these projects and work on what communities we want to go work in and what types of technology related projects wed like to pursue.', 'And Ive been involved with this organization for two and a half years now and have been the director of Action for the past two years.', 'I definitely do consider myself a team player.', 'Um one time that we experienced some conflict in one of the teams I was working on was actually in one of my Aerospace Engineering classes.', 'In this team our job was to build an RC airplane - design build and fly it.', 'And we hit some conflicts within our team because - it was mostly everyone was very busy everyone was very stressed.', 'It was towards the end of the year when everyones preparing for finals and it was just a very high-strung environment and the projects was very involved.', 'It involved machining it involved design work and coordination between a team of four.', 'And what ended up happening was well we needed to get in and find the time to actually work on our airplane and build it.', 'Whereas all of us were involved in student groups and had a very heavy courseload.', 'And conflict did arise.', 'And how we ended up solving this was we - we all decided that something needed to change.', 'And we realized that we werent putting together quality work when we were doing two people at a time or two people coming in or someone cancelling at the last minute - things like that.', 'We ended up just having to sit down lay it all out discuss whatever we needed to do to make sure that were all here - were all committing the right amount of time towards this project.', 'And honestly it was just very much a group effort and we all sat down and individually realized that we needed to prioritize.', 'And I needed to put my classes above some of my interests and my hobbies.', 'And that was something that we all decided to do as a group.', 'One thing about myself... being more on top of my work.', 'Something that I definitely need for myself is a deadline and Ive always been like that.', 'If you dont give me a deadline sometimes Ill end up dragging my feet and things get done at the last minute and its just... disorganization.', 'And so Ive been trying to deal with that by making my own small deadlines - personal deadlines - writing them down making lists and making sure that I prioritize things in advance.', 'But thats something that has taken me probably two years at MIT to learn how to do - and Im finally getting it.', 'I think I should get the job because I have a very interesting background and I believe that I have very unique experiences that could add a lot to your organization.', 'As someone with an engineering background but - as well as a management background because I am minoring in management at MIT.', 'And I think that combination adds a lot to the environment that you would like to have at your company.', 'I think putting a lot of people together in one environment trying to work on the same projects with the same background is something that is very limiting.', 'And I believe that I could add quite a bit of diversity and unique perspective to your team.']","[array([0.03580158, 0.02207752, 0.7285379 , 0.00581031, 0.2077726 ],

81,81,pp24, Sure so Im currently a junior at MIT. I grew up outside of the city in a suburb called Naydec. Ive danced my whole life and continued to do so at MIT and Im studying biology currently and for my humanities concentration concentrating on Spanish. I would say definitely in various aspects of my life I try to step up as a leader. Im currently involved in an internship through HELLO at MIT and so the point of the internship is to act as a peer network engagement intern. So basically reaching out to other Jewish students at MIT who may not be looking for a very religious atmosphere. But would just like to know that there are other Jewish students that they could connect with. And so my role as the leader of the situation is to connect various students who have similar interests either in community service or things like that and sort of set up a network for them. Sure I definitely hope that Im a team player. I think. Its definitely important to have leadership qualities but also to be able to mesh well within a group. I think this comes out a lot in lab settings where everyone from undergraduate students to PhD candidates and post Docs really have to work together on similar projects. And so being able to voice your opinions or your concerns about experiments while still taking the feedback from others and making it more of a group effort than a hierarchy I would say would be crucial. I think if I could change one thing it would probably be to have a little bit more self confidence. I think I externally try to project a calm and outgoing personality but inside I can tend to be a little bit shyer. And so I think just being able to walk into any kind of either social or business related situation and really have that confidence without having to second guess myself would help move along both career wise and just with relationships with other people. I think coming with a background from MIT would definitely help me out in this job. The biology department at MIT is really unique in its focus on research. And so I think coming into this lab setting with that background would make a strong candidate.,"[' Sure so Im currently a junior at MIT.', 'I grew up outside of the city in a suburb called Naydec.', 'Ive danced my whole life and continued to do so at MIT and Im studying biology currently and for my humanities concentration concentrating on Spanish.', 'I would say definitely in various aspects of my life I try to step up as a leader.', 'Im currently involved in an internship through HELLO at MIT and so the point of the internship is to act as a peer network engagement intern.', 'So basically reaching out to other Jewish students at MIT who may not be looking for a very religious atmosphere.', 'But would just like to know that there are other Jewish students that they could connect with.', 'And so my role as the leader of the situation is to connect various students who have similar interests either in community service or things like that and sort of set up a network for them.', 'Sure I definitely hope that Im a team player.', 'I think.', 'Its definitely important to have leadership qualities but also to be able to mesh well within a group.', 'I think this comes out a lot in lab settings where everyone from undergraduate students to PhD candidates and post Docs really have to work together on similar projects.', 'And so being able to voice your opinions or your concerns about experiments while still taking the feedback from others and making it more of a group effort than a hierarchy I would say would be crucial.', 'I think if I could change one thing it would probably be to have a little bit more self confidence.', 'I think I externally try to project a calm and outgoing personality but inside I can tend to be a little bit shyer.', 'And so I think just being able to walk into any kind of either social or business related situation and really have that confidence without having to second guess myself would help move along both career wise and just with relationships with other people.', 'I think coming with a background from MIT would definitely help me out in this job.', 'The biology department at MIT is really unique in its focus on research.', 'And so I think coming into this lab setting with that background would make a strong candidate.']","[array([0.07040236, 0.01104707, 0.24371156, 0.0046357 , 0.6702033 ],

82,82,pp25, Im good how are you? Um yeah. I am wait sorry am I ..[crosstalk] Ok um Im Kathleen Im a Core 16 major here at MITU thats um aeronautical and astronautical engineering if youre not familiar with our numbering system. Um so Ive been taking a lot of classes in aeronautical and astronautical engineering. Including some um propulsion classes um uh principals of automatic control um dynamics aerodynamics um computer engineering so I am familiar with job and mat lab Um and then also within those classes Ive done some lab work. Um including work on um a remote control airplane. Um which we did for a competition last spring. Um it was in teams of three. Um my team and the the goal is to maximize the ratio of the um the turn rate times the pay turn rate squared times the pay load. Um my team worked really hard on that um and uh we ended up coming in second um. Which was exciting a little bit disappointing but [laughter] still it was still a really fun project that we worked on. Um and then also done internships with um my most recent one was with NASA Glenn Research Center um and I worked on two projects for that. Um one was a Venus rover conceptual design. Um which was where we were trying to basically just figure out what the fees-ability would be for a small low cost rover on Venus um that would be able to fit within the budget of a discovery class mission. Um and then so that one was mostly um there was a lot of research a lot of um pulling the other information from different areas kind of because its not really a thing that people have looked at very closely before. Theres not a lot of information on the topic of how things perform in uh 450 degrees C in 90 atmospheres of pressure. Its kind of a specific thing. Um so it was um a lot of just like trying to figure out like what would work what wouldnt work. Um a lot of flexibility in the designs since it was in early stages um and a lot of um theres some some mat lab you know and analysis and um coding involved with that to. Um then the second project that we worked on for that internship was um an autonomous navigation system for small payloads um and that was an intern team project. There was totally designed and run by me and a group of seven other interns. Um so that was outside of work hours. We were putting together um it was uh steerable [inaudible] parachute. Um attached to a payload of about two or three pounds um and I was in charge of testing and designing the the parachute for that um so that was that was the second main project that we worked on. Um yes I do think Im a leader. Um and I think that Ive shown that through my work on my projects. Um being willing to to make decisions take chances with something um that may or may not work but its wi ... its important to be able to try things to figure out if thats gonna be the case or not. Um and I think that uh especially like in the the Venus rover and um also with the dropson project um since those were two projects where there werent a lot of uh specific design constraints imposed on us from the start It was really important to just um to just take an idea and run with it. Run the equations um drop it off a building in the case of the dropson [laughter] um and just see what happened um. So that was something that I got to be pretty comfortable with doing. Uh yes and yes. [laughter] Um I need a so especially with the intern team project when there were eight of us involved in this team um and that was a kind of unique experience in that there was really no like hierarchy of um control or anything it was just eight interns and we were all on equal footing. All had pretty equal experience and backgrounds um so there wasnt really anyone who was specifically in charge of that project um and that involved a lot of give and take. Um and so I think one of the biggest uh conflicts we faced as a team was when we were just deciding at the very beginning what our project was going to be. Um and this was going to be something that was gonna uh be a pretty significant part of the next ten weeks of our summer. So it was pretty important for us to choose something that was gonna was gonna go well. Um so the it ended up being a uh fairly difficult decision between the uh a design project for uh a small re-entry vehicle versus the autonomous navigation system that we did. Um and how we handled it um was we just kind of we all came together and had um a round table sort of a discussion. Um we implemented hand raising uh rules and um so as to make sure that people had equal talking time. Um and then we after we had talked for several hours um making sure that most of the important things that needed to be said would get said Um we we just voted on it um with secret ballet wrote down what our decision what decision we wanted um we counted up the votes and then we just went with that decision. Um and I think that um for me and for the other interns on the team as well it was really important that everyone recognize that whatever the outcome of the vote was was thats what we were gonna do um and we would all get on board with that project right away. Um and thats what happened um and there wasnt any like uh real I dont know bitterness or resentment about doing the project that we did. I think it pretty well. Um I would make it so that I was more organized. I often struggle to meet deadlines when I have a lot of them piled together. Not because the work is hard but because I just forget that the deadlines are coming. Um so I think that thats something that I could really work on um and I have been working on that [laughter] um by keeping notebooks and writing down uh schedules of important dates um asking friends to help me out if I know that theres something were working on together and its at the deadline or just an assignment that we both have and theres a deadline. Asking for a reminder um from my more talented friends um and keeping my Google calendar up to date as well has been helping with that. Um I think I should get this job because I am uh I am well qualified for it. Ive done projects that are um they are in the same type of area and I think that my experiences from them will really carry over so I can contribute to this job. Um and uh I think that I can also um I mean Ive also shown that Im I am a team player and a leader so I think that as well as my technical expertise I think that uh my personality fits in well with this job and I really like the environment as well that Ive seen.

83,83,pp27, Im doing well thank you. Um so Im a jun--wait...sorry I dont-- Im sorry i just uh Im just confused about like are we--are we going like the same thing last time or do I need to introduce myself again? ...like... Okay okay I got confused cause you said tell me more. Okay sorry okay I was like wait..Am I supposed to...okay sorry. Um so I am a junior at MIT studying chemistry and biology. Im primarily interested in how small molecules interact with biological systems such as um the effects of drugs or uh toxins or other uh metabolites on the body and its cells. -hmmm. Ive done research since uh like coming to MIT at in the lab of professor [sounds like] Jonessiben in chemistry and biological engineering. Ive been looking at the mechanism of a drug that is currently in phase two clinical trials... ...um for treatment of HIV. Umm in addition I have also done organic synthesis to develop um spacers for drug delivery um at the Curie Institute in Paris. I think I am a leader. Ive done work in my dorm house government as dining chair and environmental chair to take a leadership role um and help residents to um express their concerns with the dining plan -hmmm Um and to make changes to help make the residential experience um better for them. I definitely consider myself a team player. Ive uh done a lot of work in teams in my chemistry and undergraduate labs.-hmmm Uh we were often working in groups of like two or three. Um there have been conflicts in those situations where um its difficult..like if a team member uh messes up something or even uh before that if team members come to the team with different lab experience due to their research background or classes theyve taken before. -hmmm Trying to figure out how to balance it so everyone gets to ex--um do the lab and have hands on experience while at the same time making sure that things go smoothly and that we work in an efficient manor. Um so its..it can be difficult to balance these things such that everyone gets a fai-um a fair chance at doing the hands-on component but we generally resolve this by taking turns and the people who are more experienced kind of uh you know supervise in almost a mentor-like way the person who has less experience. I would-if I could change one thing about myself- it would be to l..uh to be able to let go of things that have happened and like negative things that have happened more easily because I find that sometimes I can dwell on negative things that have happened and it causes me to worry a lot about the future and become very anxious or to hinder what I want to do in the future like being concerned..you kn...being so worried about performance in a class after not doing well on an exam that I get stressed out for the next exam.-hmmm mm-hmmm. And that can create like a negative cycle so if I could change one thing it would be learning how to put bad things behind me and move ahead. Its something Ive definitely been working on and having to work on since I can to MIT where you get used to you know a lot of things -hmm mmm-hmmm mmm-hmm Not have negative things happen but learning to push through that. I think I should get the job because I have experience from my--from my course work which is very rigorous at MIT in addition to my practical experience with research which has taught me what the research process is like how to ask questions how to work independently and to pre--uh to present results and interpret them. Umm and thats good skills I think for the work place. ,"[' Im doing well thank you.', 'Um so Im a jun--wait...sorry I dont-- Im sorry i just uh Im just confused about like are we--are we going like the same thing last time or do I need to introduce myself again?', '...like...', 'Okay okay I got confused cause you said tell me more.', 'Okay sorry okay I was like wait..Am I supposed to...okay sorry.', 'Um so I am a junior at MIT studying chemistry and biology.', 'Im primarily interested in how small molecules interact with biological systems such as um the effects of drugs or uh toxins or other uh metabolites on the body and its cells.', '-hmmm.', 'Ive done research since uh like coming to MIT at in the lab of professor [sounds like] Jonessiben in chemistry and biological engineering.', 'Ive been looking at the mechanism of a drug that is currently in phase two clinical trials... ...um for treatment of HIV.', 'Umm in addition I have also done organic synthesis to develop um spacers for drug delivery um at the Curie Institute in Paris.', 'I think I am a leader.', 'Ive done work in my dorm house government as dining chair and environmental chair to take a leadership role um and help residents to um express their concerns with the dining plan -hmmm Um and to make changes to help make the residential experience um better for them.', 'I definitely consider myself a team player.', 'Ive uh done a lot of work in teams in my chemistry and undergraduate labs.-hmmm Uh we were often working in groups of like two or three.', 'Um there have been conflicts in those situations where um its difficult..like if a team member uh messes up something or even uh before that if team members come to the team with different lab experience due to their research background or classes theyve taken before.', '-hmmm Trying to figure out how to balance it so everyone gets to ex--um do the lab and have hands on experience while at the same time making sure that things go smoothly and that we work in an efficient manor.', 'Um so its..it can be difficult to balance these things such that everyone gets a fai-um a fair chance at doing the hands-on component but we generally resolve this by taking turns and the people who are more experienced kind of uh you know supervise in almost a mentor-like way the person who has less experience.', 'I would-if I could change one thing about myself- it would be to l..uh to be able to let go of things that have happened and like negative things that have happened more easily because I find that sometimes I can dwell on negative things that have happened and it causes me to worry a lot about the future and become very anxious or to hinder what I want to do in the future like being concerned..you kn...being so worried about performance in a class after not doing well on an exam that I get stressed out for the next exam.-hmmm mm-hmmm.', 'And that can create like a negative cycle so if I could change one thing it would be learning how to put bad things behind me and move ahead.', 'Its something Ive definitely been working on and having to work on since I can to MIT where you get used to you know a lot of things -hmm mmm-hmmm mmm-hmm Not have negative things happen but learning to push through that.', 'I think I should get the job because I have experience from my--from my course work which is very rigorous at MIT in addition to my practical experience with research which has taught me what the research process is like how to ask questions how to work independently and to pre--uh to present results and interpret them.', 'Umm and thats good skills I think for the work place.']","[array([0.63986886, 0.00412197, 0.18349901, 0.00686065, 0.1656495 ],

84,84,pp29, Im doing pretty well how are you? Um so as far as my technical experience background goes; um Ive worked in three different labs. Um the summer after my freshman year I worked in a lab through um through MGH and located in Charleston. I worked with a Harvard graduate student on her PH.D Thesis which involved a lot of genetics and I did a lot of like very routine lab work. Um and that was just for the summer and then the next um my soft-more year I worked in a lab here at MIT um the Engelward laboratory that works with DNA damage and I worked on an essay that quantified DNA damage using um electrophoresis. Which was nice because I got to learn a lot of um different laboratory techniques and because Im still currently working there. Ive had the time to delve into the project a little bit more have a deeper understanding than I was initially. Um and it also incorporates um components of coding like we use the math lab area um to um generate our data so its been really interesting for me. Um and also this past summer I worked in a laboratory in Israel which was really interesting they worked with all sorts of bio-sensors um so its a pretty broad um field that they worked in; and I got to work on my own project. Ive never had that type of independent freedom which was really exciting for me. Um and I think what I got more out of that was that just getting used to such a different work place and being able to acclimate myself and um be productive in that sort of environment so. Um I think Im definitely a leader I am willing to take charge of a situation um in a group of people. Im not afraid to stand out or have my opinions heard; um and on the flip-side Im not afraid to suffer consequences if uh theres any sort of negative outcome or negative or positive outcome Im willing to handle um the results. Um I think Im a team player because Im willing to agree to others peoples um ideas um the question was a what was sorry could you repeat the Conflict in my team okay. Um so I in my sorority Im on the executive board theres 10 of us and were lke in charge of the chapter; and so um weve just all been newly elected to or positions so were kind of going through the process of working out exactly what our goal is. And recently one of the topics have been like how to handle um judiciary issues like within our chapter and I have like very strong feelings on the subject as do other of my sisters. And so being able to kind of handle that and be very professional and try to be unbiased because um I have like close relations with like other sisters in the chapter has been um a challenge. And I think being able to remove myself emotionally from the situation and kind of listen to what the other people are saying and acknowledge that has been really one of the like biggest steps Ive taken into kind of overcoming those kinds of challenges. Um think all I can think is like superficial things like the ability to sing or something like that. Um I would like to be able to think a little bit faster on my feet as I took a very long time to answer that question. Um I think Ive given time I think I can come up with like good ideas and good responses and like handle issues in a good way. Um and I think that just being able to think of something a little bit quicker I know that sometimes theres like times of crisis and it takes me a little bit longer than I would like to be able to um come up with the like ideal solution. So that would be one of my things Id like to change. I think Im able to combat it pretty well by taking steps to you know mitigate the situation like handle it but ultimately that would be one thing Id like to improve on.; and why do you think you should get the job? Um I think I should get the job because Im a very hard worker and in whatever position I am in I will do it to the best of my ability. Um I have experience in a lot of different areas um as I mentioned in my lab experience and I think the aspect that makes me unique from other people looking for this position is my perspective; um Im able to see a problem pretty unbiasedly and judge what would be the best um solution and also see potential obstacles on the way there and potential outcomes; and so I think that my general overview overview of problems gives me an advantage over other people.,"[' Im doing pretty well how are you?', 'Um so as far as my technical experience background goes; um Ive worked in three different labs.', 'Um the summer after my freshman year I worked in a lab through um through MGH and located in Charleston.', 'I worked with a Harvard graduate student on her PH.D Thesis which involved a lot of genetics and I did a lot of like very routine lab work.', 'Um and that was just for the summer and then the next um my soft-more year I worked in a lab here at MIT um the Engelward laboratory that works with DNA damage and I worked on an essay that quantified DNA damage using um electrophoresis.', 'Which was nice because I got to learn a lot of um different laboratory techniques and because Im still currently working there.', 'Ive had the time to delve into the project a little bit more have a deeper understanding than I was initially.', 'Um and it also incorporates um components of coding like we use the math lab area um to um generate our data so its been really interesting for me.', 'Um and also this past summer I worked in a laboratory in Israel which was really interesting they worked with all sorts of bio-sensors um so its a pretty broad um field that they worked in; and I got to work on my own project.', 'Ive never had that type of independent freedom which was really exciting for me.', 'Um and I think what I got more out of that was that just getting used to such a different work place and being able to acclimate myself and um be productive in that sort of environment so.', 'Um I think Im definitely a leader I am willing to take charge of a situation um in a group of people.', 'Im not afraid to stand out or have my opinions heard; um and on the flip-side Im not afraid to suffer consequences if uh theres any sort of negative outcome or negative or positive outcome Im willing to handle um the results.', 'Um I think Im a team player because Im willing to agree to others peoples um ideas um the question was a what was sorry could you repeat the Conflict in my team okay.', 'Um so I in my sorority Im on the executive board theres 10 of us and were lke in charge of the chapter; and so um weve just all been newly elected to or positions so were kind of going through the process of working out exactly what our goal is.', 'And recently one of the topics have been like how to handle um judiciary issues like within our chapter and I have like very strong feelings on the subject as do other of my sisters.', 'And so being able to kind of handle that and be very professional and try to be unbiased because um I have like close relations with like other sisters in the chapter has been um a challenge.', 'And I think being able to remove myself emotionally from the situation and kind of listen to what the other people are saying and acknowledge that has been really one of the like biggest steps Ive taken into kind of overcoming those kinds of challenges.', 'Um think all I can think is like superficial things like the ability to sing or something like that.', 'Um I would like to be able to think a little bit faster on my feet as I took a very long time to answer that question.', 'Um I think Ive given time I think I can come up with like good ideas and good responses and like handle issues in a good way.', 'Um and I think that just being able to think of something a little bit quicker I know that sometimes theres like times of crisis and it takes me a little bit longer than I would like to be able to um come up with the like ideal solution.', 'So that would be one of my things Id like to change.', 'I think Im able to combat it pretty well by taking steps to you know mitigate the situation like handle it but ultimately that would be one thing Id like to improve on.', '; and why do you think you should get the job?', 'Um I think I should get the job because Im a very hard worker and in whatever position I am in I will do it to the best of my ability.', 'Um I have experience in a lot of different areas um as I mentioned in my lab experience and I think the aspect that makes me unique from other people looking for this position is my perspective; um Im able to see a problem pretty unbiasedly and judge what would be the best um solution and also see potential obstacles on the way there and potential outcomes; and so I think that my general overview overview of problems gives me an advantage over other people.']","[array([0.37418047, 0.00358338, 0.00722217, 0.0006862 , 0.6143277 ],

85,85,pp3, Hah.. uh yeah..so.. uhm Im chase and I guess uh. Aww man okay so ive done web development for a long time I started in abotu 8th grade and actually started making a few sites just back then and for the heck of it and uhm just started making some money through them sold a website through them which was great. Uhm and through all fo this I got an internship for my sophmore year of high school which was awesome. It was through a job search website called indeed and over there I did a ton of different stuff and from internationalization I was one of the first people to start the internationalization forum for indeed and so theyve now expanded to four countries and I think the international traffic revenue is like 30% of their company now. They also just got sold for like a billion dollars uh I believe..about three weeks ago or something which was really cool. But at the same time I dont really want to work there anymore because they have been sold and I dont really know the owner anymore where as I did previously and that was great where I dont know otherwise coming to MITF you know had aphenomenal blast up there. I had been studying computer science..uhm really enjoyed it and spent a lot of time on a lot of various side projects and just ahnging out with people so like I dont know making really cool robotics stuff... uhm like cool educational software.. uhm some kinnect tax and different things like this. Uhm..I would I..I would go this.. I I would say there is kind of uhm from two standpoints both from high school and from college in high school I was the captain of our ultimate frisbee team..uhm and so I started it in my junior year and just got all my friends because we used to play frisbee all with each other and I said hey why dont we start competing and make this happen liek three times a week or soemthing and so we went ahead and did this and uhm.. uh started practicing enough and I had to make sure that everything was coordinated and that people actually came to practices I mean you like had to have everyone come and everything otherwise no one is going to wanna play or there is going to be no ability to play basically.. so uhm we played enough so that we were actually able to get 3rd in uhm well actually 3rd in my senior year 5th my junior year and uh in the state of texas in frisbee which is uh impressive without a coach. Uh otherwise I was also the captain of the crosscountry team and uhm uh captain of uhm uh the track team as well so uhm that um roles been more minimal more of an inspirational role like make sure you come to practice sort of thing. of stuff and uhm in college here Ive been working with a group called saftey fp and uh which promotes student wellness around campus sounds like youve heard of it. uhm and yeah so just making sure we have awesome events that happen I just recently read an event called super smash bros turned in which was really great uhm..I dont know anything about super smash bros so... I had to actually go get the the other people that knew a lot about it and made sure they told all their friends about it and got them to actually figure out the whole thing the whole logistics and that wa sme just getting them excited about it and and convinced them to get a lot of people to come. Uhm okay definitely I enjoy teams like no other Im at MIT specifically I go out of my way to like working in teams and in any different aspect and for the most part Ive had really great teams in general but uhm just this semester Im actually working on a start up with a friend so hes been working on it a while and hes just such an awesome guy that I was just like Oh i want to build stuff for you so I am kind of doing contract work for him we are just hacking together all the time really just like there are no conflicts there frankly but I find but otherwise for my year off for my reasearch that Im doing here for MIT uhm i had previously uh a research postion at uh my freshman year uhm but I did not really like it that much because I had to do it by myself because it was an android thing I mean I dont know I feel like I can always do stuff by myself it does not have to be in a group but now actually i just tell all my friends if they hear about an opp they should just invite me to do it with you because I would just love to do a year off with someone because like Id love to have someone that I like to working with and to work on the same product would make everything so much better so like my friend does this cool photography and I just do the tech thing it is fun but in terms of conflicts Ive had uhm I feel like conflicts are a general minimal for the uhm the most part that I have found its most like who is going to do what uhm and in these cases uhm and for the most part and uhm im pretty flexible basically thats how I just go around stuff and just try and explain everything very well to everyone just to make sure everyone knows exactly what is going on and just reinterating all this to everyone so that *cough cough* at least then so everyone is on the same page. Because for the most part people generally care to be fair but you just have to describe to everyone how they understand things. Uhm okay so I would  something I woudl change about myself okay so thats interesting uhm oh okay I would almost uhm heh uhm..the dumb answer to this would be that I woudl like to be a bit taller i think that would always help. Uhm but I think I can also interpret this question on what would I like to work on..or what am I working on. And like in thsi case i would definitely go for uhm actually my ability to speak ah hah and uhm just in general and uh like I find for now for example like how I kind of seem like I understand what Im tlaking about for exmample for the most part I *mumbles* everynow and then but uhm what Im actually thinking about harder problems and Im trying to explain myself where I just worked on a hard problem I only looked at once so I dont fully understand everything for the most part I get it in my head but when I try and explain it to someone i its actually pretty hard to me. And to uhm..everything in an uhm I guess interesting manner well almost and kind of say it once instead of say something and then which is what I do freqently and then I say oh wait that does not make sense let me try another avenue. I just keep trying different avanues until the other person gets it but I would love to be able to just give it that first time I can just think for a second and say okay this is exactly what I need to say. Use the vocabulary words I need to use which frankly Im not that good at and in terms of expanding my vocabulary and expanding my words for whatever like dictionary or see I dont even know the word like my expanse of the vocabulary that exists in my head and uh on an given and at any given time not as large as it should be. Uhm So I know I.. I would say it just comes down to the passion for the most part I just really enjoy anything that I am working on if I am ever going to pck something to work on i bascially just go at it full force I always tlak to my friends about it its always on my mind in the shower its like always in the top of my mind I am working on a problem and I have to get that problem finished and I basically I never really feel like suffer from burn out that may be because I havent worked on soemthing enough uhm but uhm for the msot part i really enjoy working on stuff and I just its my passion and my passion is actually just like working when i get tired of working i work on something else its actually a relaxing state like if I am working here for example I do hard in all my classes I just start programming.

It was a start up in Venice Beach California and I enjoyed it quite a bit.re a leader? Tell me why? I think that I ca be a leader. I am definitely not one that tends to lead. I am perfectly happy to play a more supportive role because in my experience especially here there are plenty of people who like to lead and leaders are not needed. That said if theres something that needs to be done and nobody is stepping up to do it that is something that I can and will adapt to I would absolutely consider myself a team player. I care more about people than basically anything else. Conflict? Im sorry I am trying to think of a story.s all right a class project or anything like that? So to be honest I havent experienced major conflicts in general. Honestly I think it is best to keep open terms of communication I that makes it so that you cant have a disaster happen. There can be minor disagreements but they never turn into big conflicts. Id be smarter yeah obviously but I think I would like to have a better capability to understand those sides of things. Sorry that sounds really weird. In general I do but for computer science or science specifically theres the part that I am really good at which is everything that has to do with languages and puzzle solving thats great. Thats fun. I like it a lot. But then there is also the side that is a little bit more mathematical and that is something that I struggle with. They are definitely different things people are typically good at either one or the other but being good at both is a little less common and that would be really awesome.

87,87,pp31, Im good how are you?m good. Tell me a little more about your background. Uh so Im a junior in computer science and math at MIT. Uh Im personally interested in [] systems uh and uh [] tolerance those are slightly more my research interests then my applied interests so when it comes to applied things which youre probably more interested in um I tend to prefer parallel computing. Um I have some experience in that from classes um both including performance engineering and parallel computing as well as from my internship with Amazon where we actually pushed a product that I made. You can see it I if you look online uh author rank was my intern product. s great. [laugh] ok you think youre a leader tell me why. Um… I have some leadership experience but I think that so in my teens for 6172 which is a project based live class … its been a lot of work. Um I tend to be the person who does some of the organizing of team meetings but mostly within a given meeting I tend to be like for a non-trivial portion of the work. The person who is leading the discussions of whats the next technical step we should do you know should we take approach A or  should we take approach A or B based on time work you know man hours we have due dates uh points etcetera. Um and so I you know perform leadership skills in a technical capacity more than a managerial one. In a sense that I dont do so much of the organizing of meeting times. Um I do think Im a team player um so can I ask what kind of flavor of conflict youre looking for? Like a technical disagreement or… Ok um well while I was working at Amazon um we had many times the problem that the business decision would change or um become apparent slowly over time as we continued designing because actually the design process started getting [] over the internship and the product shipped shortly after my internship [] So that was kind of crazy um and you may expect with a project like that I ended up not working on the front end because it was way too much work for one intern to do for the summer um but negotiating with the business team and with other technical people about what parts of the product we were going to ship was a challenge. As an example Amazon often has uh like you know lots of features like any company like to employ and some of these are like change over time features. And as it turns out given the way we were implementing everything change over time features where it looked that longer periods of time would be much more computationally intensive and like also programmer time intensive um both of which werent going to work for what we were trying to do for our deadline because we couldnt order more computational power within the time period and we only had so many man hours. And um trying to decide what things would be worked on and what wouldnt was a conflict of the team um and I did my best um you know I was an intern um but I did my best to like present the technical issues present my understanding of how long things would take um and try to you know encourage people to take the direction they wanted but in the case that a choice was made that wasnt you know what I wanted uh you know I would go along with it. I wasnt you know going to be petulant or continue trying to you know argue my way and not do their way like if the team decided this was the best thing like I went ahead and did it. Uh Smarter.[both laugh] Um Im going to respond to this question by answering what I would change about myself thats sort of something I could just spend more time on um to change. And I can tell you something that Im currently working on. Which is that when Im stressed and tired I notice that I become snippy is one word for it. Uh and while people who have worked with me and you know work on psats until 4 am or you know working on these intense projects you know claim that I tend to be pretty reasonable like it does decrease team unity and happiness . When its like getting to be 4am and I respond shortly as opposed to you know sounding nice and happy about it. Um so something Im working on is like removing the sounds of frustration from my voice especially in time of frustration because it more important then when everybodys frustrated and tired to like not escalate situations. Um and even if Im not responding with anger and just responding in like a voice that portrays frustration you can worry that like itll make other people more frustrated. 	 Um Im technically competent I think my uh the classes Ive taken and how well Ive done in them as well as you know any of the people you contact like Amazon will say positive things about me uh I get along well with people um and so whatever team you put me on will likely enjoy my company.[Laughs] Um and I think most importantly computer science is a huge part of my life and what I do and I fully and legitimately enjoy my job especially if you give interesting technical problems Um and Im sure thats what your company will do right?[Laughs] So Im not going to be just like sitting around biding my time waiting for the work day to end and Im actually going be here on time and Im going to leave and go home and do other things and like come back and be excited to be coming back to work and

88,88,pp32, Im good how are you? Yeah I paced here hahaha Ok I am a junior at MIT currently uh working on my bachelors degree in biology and Ive been heavily involved in student groups so far and during my time here Ive been at uh Im currently the president of the MIT armenian society the editor in chief of the MIT undergraduate research journal and uh um also executive team of the Biology Students Association uh and I thats why Im sort of trying to get into healthcare industry and consulting cuz I dont have a lot of experience in the life sciences so far. I do think Im a leader. Um I so- always end up taking the lead on uh when theres a big group and someo-someone has to start ha taking the wheel and uh getting people started working. Um Ive been really involved in the groups that Ive -heheh joined since my freshman year and uh so far Ive done some pretty crazy things such as organizing a hundred plus networking event for the armenian society where I definitely had to um you know uh work with uh the team and get them motivated enough to help me with this like big task a lot of people-a lot of kids on my team dont really like the whole social um event planning part of things but um I had to kind of engage them and uh that was an interesting thing for me to learn actually how to tap into what makes people take and what gets them motivated so how to give them initiative to do things on their own so. Yeah Yeah uh definitely I-I-I would say that Im a team player and um one thing I can say is that uh last year at the MIT MIT undergraduate research role we uh had to publish an issue uh in the fall where it became late and we had to uh work together as a team to get that done. uh one one thing that may I may have done wrong on my part was maybe I-I-I didnt um get my department to uh work hard enough to get the deadline make the deadline so um in the spring semester when we were trying to uh make it make uh make the deadline in the spring semester to publish uh in the first week of the spring semester I had to do the same thing that I did with our (research?) I-or was get everyone to be motivated and have initiative to do things on their own and really like work hard to get t-ah that deadline so yeah. mhmm Interesting question. Uh I would change my lack of willingness that sometimes to approach new people and you know put myself into new situations that Im not comfortable with.

89,89,pp33, Good how are you? So my background is primarily in energy work. So Im a chemical engineering student and Im very interested in not only alternative energy but the optimization of our traditional energy resources. Um so thats thats where my uh background in well in gas comes in. Um but also some of my research interests are you know kind of scientific ideas. Um I definitely think I am. Uh partially because even when Im not the designated leader somehow it turns into me leading the team. But I really enjoy that. I think that one of the most satisfying feelings is having your team tel you that youre doing a great job or that they think that um that success can be highly attributed to you. So I think that in terms of my leadership style I always want to bring out the strengths of the team members. So I think thats really how my position as a leader really works. I try to figure out what would maximize the potential of this team member or that team member. And how can we bring all of those together. Um yeah so I definitely consider myself a team player. Its tough to be a good leader without being a good team player. Ah but one instance where I was both the leader and also a team player um was in the Society of Women Engineers banquet. So when we planned it it was...Im the vice president of corporate relations and I have six people who work with me and we planned a banquet for about 200 people both company representatives and students. And um and its a very collaborative effort. Like I may be the VP but were all you know pulling a lot of the weight. And so during the actual event we had four company representatives for two different companies show up to the event without RSVP-ing or anything. Uh it was the selection for the companies was pretty extensive and the selection for the students was pretty extensive. So what we were trying to do was get a good range of industries and then match students with their interests. So its not something where you can be like Oh yeah sit right down but so in terms of being a team player they approached one of the other members of the team. She didnt really know what to do um kind of bounced it to a few different people but I knew that that was something that wouldnt look good. So I definitely helped her out out of that awkward situation and kind of took the blame on myself essentially because these representatives were pretty angry that Oh you dont have our name tags you dont have our seats? Whats going on? And so I you know part of being a team player is knowing when its best to take the blame on yourself. And in the end we found places for them to sit. So we had some no-show students you know among like a hundred whatever students you definitely have people that dont show up. So they didnt get to sit with like exactly the right students or anything but we found them a place and fed them dinner. So that helped. I wish I was more patient. Um I think I a lot of times and very eager to start a task. This especially comes out uh were in a lab group right now. Or Im in a lab class and I work with a lab group um in that class and we are all we kind of have this trait of um oh as soon as the chemicals are out on the bench oh lets mix this lets do this lets do this. But a lot of time we end up finishing a little bit later than other groups because we have to we problem solve. We get all the problems first you know other people not having necessarily tried this we find that this doesnt work at all. So we face all those hurdles first whereas if we had if we could take a few minutes wait think it out uh maybe let somebody else try something first for a change um I think that would helps us be a little bit more effective. And I think in other situations too its kind of strategic and advantageous to wait but its sometimes hard for me to see those opportunities. So I definitely thats definitely something that Ive been working on is you know when when is that also a viable option to just sit back for a few days and just think about it. I think that I would bring a great deal of enthusiasm. In addition to the skills and background that I have I think that Im so excited um for the work that your company is doing and to kind of play off the other members of the team as well. Um so not just stick to my own project but also be contributing to the other projects that are going on and try to find synergies within our team.,"[' Good how are you?', 'So my background is primarily in energy work.', 'So Im a chemical engineering student and Im very interested in not only alternative energy but the optimization of our traditional energy resources.', 'Um so thats thats where my uh background in well in gas comes in.', 'Um but also some of my research interests are you know kind of scientific ideas.', 'Um I definitely think I am.', 'Uh partially because even when Im not the designated leader somehow it turns into me leading the team.', 'But I really enjoy that.', 'I think that one of the most satisfying feelings is having your team tel you that youre doing a great job or that they think that um that success can be highly attributed to you.', 'So I think that in terms of my leadership style I always want to bring out the strengths of the team members.', 'So I think thats really how my position as a leader really works.', 'I try to figure out what would maximize the potential of this team member or that team member.', 'And how can we bring all of those together.', 'Um yeah so I definitely consider myself a team player.', 'Its tough to be a good leader without being a good team player.', 'Ah but one instance where I was both the leader and also a team player um was in the Society of Women Engineers banquet.', 'So when we planned it it was...Im the vice president of corporate relations and I have six people who work with me and we planned a banquet for about 200 people both company representatives and students.', 'And um and its a very collaborative effort.', 'Like I may be the VP but were all you know pulling a lot of the weight.', 'And so during the actual event we had four company representatives for two different companies show up to the event without RSVP-ing or anything.', 'Uh it was the selection for the companies was pretty extensive and the selection for the students was pretty extensive.', 'So what we were trying to do was get a good range of industries and then match students with their interests.', 'So its not something where you can be like Oh yeah sit right down but so in terms of being a team player they approached one of the other members of the team.', 'She didnt really know what to do um kind of bounced it to a few different people but I knew that that was something that wouldnt look good.', 'So I definitely helped her out out of that awkward situation and kind of took the blame on myself essentially because these representatives were pretty angry that Oh you dont have our name tags you dont have our seats?', 'Whats going on?', 'And so I you know part of being a team player is knowing when its best to take the blame on yourself.', 'And in the end we found places for them to sit.', 'So we had some no-show students you know among like a hundred whatever students you definitely have people that dont show up.', 'So they didnt get to sit with like exactly the right students or anything but we found them a place and fed them dinner.', 'So that helped.', 'I wish I was more patient.', 'Um I think I a lot of times and very eager to start a task.', 'This especially comes out uh were in a lab group right now.', 'Or Im in a lab class and I work with a lab group um in that class and we are all we kind of have this trait of um oh as soon as the chemicals are out on the bench oh lets mix this lets do this lets do this.', 'But a lot of time we end up finishing a little bit later than other groups because we have to we problem solve.', 'We get all the problems first you know other people not having necessarily tried this we find that this doesnt work at all.', 'So we face all those hurdles first whereas if we had if we could take a few minutes wait think it out uh maybe let somebody else try something first for a change um I think that would helps us be a little bit more effective.', 'And I think in other situations too its kind of strategic and advantageous to wait but its sometimes hard for me to see those opportunities.', 'So I definitely thats definitely something that Ive been working on is you know when when is that also a viable option to just sit back for a few days and just think about it.', 'I think that I would bring a great deal of enthusiasm.', 'In addition to the skills and background that I have I think that Im so excited um for the work that your company is doing and to kind of play off the other members of the team as well.', 'Um so not just stick to my own project but also be contributing to the other projects that are going on and try to find synergies within our team.']","[array([4.5620534e-01, 7.4880529e-04, 4.1863765e-04, 4.9901620e-04,

90,90,pp34, Doing pretty good. So I am a uh mechanical engineer at MIT. Umm I am a junior and Im really interested in product design. So Ive been taking a lot of classes in design and manufacturing and its something Ive really fallen in love with...Like last semester um especially I took this class called...[0:25 unclear] Product Design and its really got me introduced to solid works and using machine tools and its something that Id love to do in um for the rest of my life in a professional fashion. Uh I would say that I am. I do enjoy being in a position where I can really guide a group um towards some forward direction uh... So this past year I was philanthropy chair of my sorority and we put on this big event called Cat Walk. Its this charity fashion show. Um and its its so much fun but it took tons of planning and... Yeah coordination between like throughout the entire sorority which has one-hundred forty girls in it... Um and everyone had to play a role so its...really difficult sometimes cause people arent really sure whats going on and theres a lot of... ...miscommunication and things... Umm but I feel like it ran really smoothly um because I had two co-chairs and we all really worked together to keep things very organized um regimented to like keep after people...especially in the summer when everyones all over the country all over the world. Right? And you have to just keep emailing them calling them if you can um checking up on them but you know? Finding a balance you have to learn to trust the people that are under you right? Um and just make sure they have a good idea of whats going on and they feel like theyre playing an important role because they are... Um so that happened actually two weeks ago... the event... It was so much fun! It was a little bit stressful as we got closer to the event... ...You know things go wrong and things go missing. Um... but I feel like I was able to stay very calm and just like help people find alternatives if they...If I dont know if like a rehearsal time didnt work or a designer wasnt showing up. Um it was just best to find a very efficient logical way to proceed. Uh I would say that Im a team player. Again like even when in a leadership role youre not just the one person doing the... ...thing. Um I would say that being a team player applied to Cat Walk as well but um for a different example perhaps... I might return to to product design where we had to work in a smaller team of about uh there were five students and two mentors. Um and we all came from different backgrounds and none of us knew each other beforehand. We all had very different skill sets and very different personalities... Um so in the beginning especially we all had ideas that really clashed and for the class in a way that was good because then we could come up with all these different ideas and its great... ...But then when it came down to deciding on one or figuring out how you wanted to move forward who would take on which responsibilities it was um quite tense (laughs) for our team I would say... Um so as the oldest two on the team myself and one other teammate we... I feel like we really stepped it up in terms of being um very methodical and very like... ...Fair I guess? In the way that we tried to distribute things? And when things got too heated um I feel like I especially served as kind of a mediator calming people down and just like having them think about yknow whats practical what are you actually able to get done? Um what do you want to get done? Cause you want to make sure that people work on things that theyre passionate about um so they can do their best work.

91,91,pp35, Fine thanks how are you? Well Im a junior at MIT and currently Im majoring in Computer Science and molecular biology with a minor in Management. Um my work background Ive done a year op at uh in Boydens Lab uh which is in neurobiology lab and I really like that but Im interested in maybe pursuing Finance as a career. So the past two summers um Ive worked in financial services. Um my freshman summer I worked at Standard & Poors and last summer I worked at Wells Fargo.  Uh I definitely think Im a leader because uh currently Im on a lot of planning boards for different things uh Im actually on the Executive Board on Smart Womens Securities which is a finance club and Ive really helped it grow from a very small group of about ten members to now we have like 30 or 40 students attending each of our seminar series so its been great being in a marketing role for that club uh because Ive been able to pub on campus and get people to come out to our events. Uh yes I think Im a team player um one time this was for one of my classes we had a project uh it was in a class called software programming in Java. So the project was actually centered after Spring Break and it was due on that Wednesday. However one of my friends who was supposed to be in charge of another part of the project was gone the entire Spring Break on a bike trip and didnt bring his computer. So he came back to school and said guys sorry I havent done anything and well that was a very bad conflict for our team so I kind of took charge and said Look okay Ill finish the parser and you write just test cases for the entire program instead since obviously you havent even started looking at it. So yeah we ended up getting an A on that project thankfully but it was a marathon sprint to the finish. This is a very loaded question. Um I think one thing I might change about myself is being a little bit more proactive in everything I do sometimes Im a little too passive but yeah I think thats the main thing I would change about myself. - I would try to make myself take more initiatives. I think I should get the job because Im a very strong candidate in this industry and I have a lot of prior experience in Finance so... Also Im very motivated and Ill get work done,"[' Fine thanks how are you?', 'Well Im a junior at MIT and currently Im majoring in Computer Science and molecular biology with a minor in Management.', 'Um my work background Ive done a year op at uh in Boydens Lab uh which is in neurobiology lab and I really like that but Im interested in maybe pursuing Finance as a career.', 'So the past two summers um Ive worked in financial services.', 'Um my freshman summer I worked at Standard & Poors and last summer I worked at Wells Fargo.', 'Uh I definitely think Im a leader because uh currently Im on a lot of planning boards for different things uh Im actually on the Executive Board on Smart Womens Securities which is a finance club and Ive really helped it grow from a very small group of about ten members to now we have like 30 or 40 students attending each of our seminar series so its been great being in a marketing role for that club uh because Ive been able to pub on campus and get people to come out to our events.', 'Uh yes I think Im a team player um one time this was for one of my classes we had a project uh it was in a class called software programming in Java.', 'So the project was actually centered after Spring Break and it was due on that Wednesday.', 'However one of my friends who was supposed to be in charge of another part of the project was gone the entire Spring Break on a bike trip and didnt bring his computer.', 'So he came back to school and said guys sorry I havent done anything and well that was a very bad conflict for our team so I kind of took charge and said Look okay Ill finish the parser and you write just test cases for the entire program instead since obviously you havent even started looking at it.', 'So yeah we ended up getting an A on that project thankfully but it was a marathon sprint to the finish.', 'This is a very loaded question.', 'Um I think one thing I might change about myself is being a little bit more proactive in everything I do sometimes Im a little too passive but yeah I think thats the main thing I would change about myself.', '- I would try to make myself take more initiatives.', 'I think I should get the job because Im a very strong candidate in this industry and I have a lot of prior experience in Finance so...

92,92,pp37, Little cold. Pretty well. How are you? I have some quantity and analytical experience from Qua work on financial team last summer in terms of working experience a in terms of academic experience I have a apply a math major probably double major with course fifteen which is management so I taken a lot of probability statistics classes. Ah I think I am a leader mainly because I take a leadership positions I can be very effective in guiding the group whatever it is toward our goal. If it is team in the class on the research project even if there is a like assign leadership role I usually end up organizing things between people stuff like that. So I do feel like I am a little bet a natural leader A when I was in competitive swimming summer for fifteen years pretty much my whole life and so I had lots of different experiences being on the swim team specially on (??) I did for two years specialty on m rely team there is only four slots on the rely and we are usually very competitive on the national level so last year we had lots of conflict a because one of my best fiends really wonted to be on the rely but then you know she is getting bit up by a teammates and there is all that drama over that and it put me in a tough position because was my best friend but then was also you know you wont to put together the fastest rely to be competitive so really all of was wont to stay out of it and let the coaches deal with that but I did learn a lot about how to interact with people on all sides of the situation because I steel had to get along with all my teammates and support my best friend and try to help her. I think I would like to be better in asking for help not that I necessarily needed a lot but I think it would be useful for me and like branch out and learn from different people so I am really interested in math and management so I get really into those types of classes I guess I wish I would branch out little bet more in to different areas because I can learn from people there. Si I am trying to take some different classes now that I ma done with all of my math and stuff like that. Thats probably what I should change.

Uhh in addition to that Ive covered a lot of programming and programming work. umm both in and out of school umm so that has included uhh basically building a UAV from scratch as well as umm working on UAV programming for the department of defense umm which has uhh been done for collision avoidance for a lot of the UAVs now flying in the air.  So yeah I do think Im a leader umm so for example uhh right now Im actually holding several different leadership positions. uhh first of all I am the residential director for a group called [medlinks?] in my dorm uhh what we do is we provide students uhh health care support basically. uhh we are authorized to give out over the counter medicines to other students uhh in our dorm and as well as well as elsewhere. uhh were certified first aid and some basic emergency care and were also there for uhh basically student health counseling um so in my position as residential director umm I basically talk to the dorm executive board as well as the medlinks executive board and uhh we basically work together I work as the Liason between the groups um and I basically help plan events um I work with them to resolve whatever issues are coming up I [xx] meetings for them umm basically to help support basically the people who support our dorm. umm in addition to that I kind of have like a quirky side leadership position which is umm as president of the MIT tapioca club umm we make and distribute large quantities of tapioca so every once in a while umm we will I will be organizing a whole bunch of students getting together maybe like a night or two of crazy cooking umm you know ha ha Umm sure so uhh yes I do consider myself a team player Ive had to work in a whole bunch of different teams for example one time there was a bit of a conflict umm well it was basically when last year I was working on a uhh one of my assignments for an engineering class uh we had a problem in which basically one of the students wouldnt show up one of the other students [xx] let me get this straight one of the students had trouble showing up for basically the team meetings and another one of them kind of basically got [xx] at that. So the way I helped umm sort of resolve this conflict and basically bring everybody together to try to work out the project was I basically took it upon myself to help the person to figure out why the person who wasnt showing up wasnt showing up umm and I basically helped him work through some of the stuff that he had issues with mainly he wasnt showing up mainly because he felt he didnt like wasnt able to contribute enough didnt know enough about the programs we were working with so I basically sat there and talked him through it helped him basically develop some of the skills necessary to work with it so in that way he basically showed up a lot more he was much more productive and useful to the team and that also um basically helped resolve the conflict we had in which we had you know we avoided losing a team member basically and we avoided another problem of umm basically an annoyed team member having to deal with a person who he felt wasnt doing his job. Um so this is actually something that I am actively working on I feel that I should be more compassionate um this is actually something that um so during my medlinks training something that actually appeared um basically what we were doing we were doing a bit of an exercise um in which we were presented with a couple of different cases to basically umm illustrate how it might be for a person to go through some very very difficult uh I guess difficult times or difficult trials um and so we were basic we were given scenarios to imagine sort of like umm maybe the loss of a loved one or the loss of a secure place to be uh loss of some sort of you know a whole bunch of different losing things and um I guess I wasnt I wasnt as moved as other students were primarily because Ive been through all of the examples that they gave so I dont know I guess on one hand thats a good thing on the other hand thats a bad thing but umm what that pointed out to me was that like I wasnt perhaps able to empathize as well as the others were um despite I dont know either despite or specifically because I had been through that and um part of the reason that I joined medlinks and am now currently actually trying to join the [MITEMS?] umm not because I want to pursue medicine as a career but one because I want to develop those skills and two because I want to sort of develop and exercise more compassion. Um so I think I should get the job basically because of one my past experiences which have prepared me fairly well for the kind of employee that your looking for a person with good strong aerospace and science background as well as strong coding skills that are necessary for the umm basically kind of projects that I know you are working on. additionally I feel that I am a very reliable person um I have demonstrated that through my leadership positions through the things that I have initia- um sort of taken the initiative to engage in such as the various programs I mentioned and you know the things I am trying to do right now because of that I feel that I would be a valuable asset to your team. Its what it sounds like. We try to make it more than boba tea umm currently we have primarily made boba tea so its like I think weve done like two or three events and basically every time its like ok Im gonna go to china town get like twenty to thirty pounds of tapioca bring it back and then like well spend like basically a night or two cooking making large quantities of tea I think what were trying to do right now is kind of actually get enough funds to get a cup sealing machine that way the club will be self sustainable cause like right now its MIT funded but its so new that they wont give it consistent funding we

94,94,pp42, My background is I grew up in Japan and wanted to go to M.I.T. to study aerospace engineering wanted to fly for a very long time now. I am in Sigma Alpha Epsilon a fraternity on campus. And I am also a member of Air Force ROTC. I do think Im a leader. I have had many opportunities to lead. Um both in a in a range of environments where its its pure leadership and also areas its very clear that Im the one in charge and that people should be listening to me. And Ive also had a good amount of theoretical education on this and most of those opportunities and the educations been through ROTC. But I have also had a decent amount of chances to lead through things like student government in high school and through my fraternity in college. I do think Im a team player. I like to be on part of a team where the mission is something I agree with and if I am then Ill work my absolute hardest and try to make sacrifices for the team. In terms of a team that had conflict that I was um I was apart of uh hmm let me think of examples I didnt use the first time. [pause] I have to go back to high school. Um so student government was a really big thing for me in high school. It was probably my favorite activity my favorite non-athletic activity that I did and it was a little bit difficult to get participation especially during busier times for school because people would have so many other commitments to go to. So in some of the committees we had inside student government Junior Senior year there would just be not enough people for not even a quorum to be reached. So-[laughs] The way I tried to change that was just making the events we do more fun and having people specifically agree on those things that were on the committee beforehand. So then they- we knew that everybody had kind of an investment in it. One thing about myself hmm. [laughs] Well kind of as a joke right now one thing definitely have a leg thats healed. [laughs] Um but- I guess- [laughs] Personality traits are something of that nature. [pause] Um I think i can be a little bit more agr- or not a little bit a decently am- a decent more- a decent amount more agreeable. Sometimes I certainly can have an opinion on a stance and once its developed its quite hard to change. I can dig my heels in when someones kind of trying to argue the Congress. So if I could be just a little more open minded and certainly more agreeable I think that would help me out in the long run.- maybe in the military maybe [?]. Why do you think you should get this job? I think that I should be able to get this job because I have a lot to contribute to the company. I learn so much in my undergrad and Ive been wanting to apply that to a real- to a tough problem that has real uh repercussions to the general public. And Ive learned a lot of uh theoretical knowledge on on how to solve these problems. Ive also learned a lot of practical things by being in projects and working in groups and and learning how to handle a range- or a multitude of different dynamics. Um I- if- if the team is working towards a goal which I agree on and this company certainly is- I- Ill put absolutely a hundred percent of effort into it and work late and- and really try to get that goal um or really try to work towards that goal.,"[' My background is I grew up in Japan and wanted to go to M.I.T.', 'to study aerospace engineering wanted to fly for a very long time now.', 'I am in Sigma Alpha Epsilon a fraternity on campus.', 'And I am also a member of Air Force ROTC.', 'I do think Im a leader.', 'I have had many opportunities to lead.', 'Um both in a in a range of environments where its its pure leadership and also areas its very clear that Im the one in charge and that people should be listening to me.', 'And Ive also had a good amount of theoretical education on this and most of those opportunities and the educations been through ROTC.', 'But I have also had a decent amount of chances to lead through things like student government in high school and through my fraternity in college.', 'I do think Im a team player.', 'I like to be on part of a team where the mission is something I agree with and if I am then Ill work my absolute hardest and try to make sacrifices for the team.', 'In terms of a team that had conflict that I was um I was apart of uh hmm let me think of examples I didnt use the first time.', '[pause] I have to go back to high school.', 'Um so student government was a really big thing for me in high school.', 'It was probably my favorite activity my favorite non-athletic activity that I did and it was a little bit difficult to get participation especially during busier times for school because people would have so many other commitments to go to.', 'So in some of the committees we had inside student government Junior Senior year there would just be not enough people for not even a quorum to be reached.', 'So-[laughs] The way I tried to change that was just making the events we do more fun and having people specifically agree on those things that were on the committee beforehand.', 'So then they- we knew that everybody had kind of an investment in it.', 'One thing about myself hmm.', '[laughs] Well kind of as a joke right now one thing definitely have a leg thats healed.', '[laughs] Um but- I guess- [laughs] Personality traits are something of that nature.', '[pause] Um I think i can be a little bit more agr- or not a little bit a decently am- a decent more- a decent amount more agreeable.', 'Sometimes I certainly can have an opinion on a stance and once its developed its quite hard to change.', 'I can dig my heels in when someones kind of trying to argue the Congress.', 'So if I could be just a little more open minded and certainly more agreeable I think that would help me out in the long run.- maybe in the military maybe [?].', 'Why do you think you should get this job?', 'I think that I should be able to get this job because I have a lot to contribute to the company.', 'I learn so much in my undergrad and Ive been wanting to apply that to a real- to a tough problem that has real uh repercussions to the general public.', 'And Ive learned a lot of uh theoretical knowledge on on how to solve these problems.', 'Ive also learned a lot of practical things by being in projects and working in groups and and learning how to handle a range- or a multitude of different dynamics.', 'Um I- if- if the team is working towards a goal which I agree on and this company certainly is- I- Ill put absolutely a hundred percent of effort into it and work late and- and really try to get that goal um or really try to work towards that goal.']","[array([0.09601805, 0.26470345, 0.29175428, 0.00200966, 0.34551457],

96,96,pp44,d like to I know a little bit about your background.  Sure um [clears throat] sorry. Uh I am a junior in Computer Science here at MIT.-hm. Im from [??] Kentucky. Uh particularly interesting in uh consumer [??] products um front end development. Um Ive had some experience doing both web development and some uh internal metrics testing and QA type of jobs. So thats a little bit about my technical background.re a leader. Tell me why. I do think Im a leader. I think one of the biggest qualities a leader needs to have is dealing with people.-hm. Uh people skills are very important. Ive been involved in many situations that uh involve both conflict resolution with people involve organizing people towards a certain a certain purpose or goal which I think is uh very important uh quality of being a leader. For example um previous uh work uh Ive done with one of [??] organizations on campus called Camp [??] of MIT uh we had a committee that my myself and my co-coordinator had a committee which we we used to organize the unions for campers and um newsletters for uh families. Uh to give you more context with that uh my job in that organization was to be a liaison between organization which was a student camp a student run camp for kids whose parents have or had had cancer – - and being a liaison for the organization in the families who go to that camp. So that was my whole last year and I believe I was able to organize uh I believe pretty effectively. Right now Im uh also a member of the MIT dance troupe which uh is a dance group on campus. And Ive uh Im choreog -  Im a choreographer. So Im organizing people there and definitely making sure we meet our deadlines on time for the big show that we hold every semester. So I think I can uh organize people pretty effectively and uh have a really good [??]. Sure okay. Um I think dealing with doing these… Lets go with so uh the same organization Camp [??] organization last year as the coordinator for the uh families. A big challenge for us was uh organizing our data. Um so how that so essentially what I mean by that is each uh family had to apply uh with their campers applications but the applications itself are pretty pretty heavy and require a lot of information doctors records medical records and so people would send in their applications at different parts – - uh during the year. Um so they would never usually send in a full application. So keeping track of that um proved to be pretty pretty challenging in itself. Um there were about three of us that they would send different parts to uh and there were about ninety campers or about a hundred campers who ended up sending in documents. So uh making sure that uh my team was communicating was important very very important. In order to get through that – - um we decided to develop a uh sort of tool for uh organizing. In the sense that – - uh whoever received that piece of the application would enter it in to this sort of database we decided to construct.-hm. Uh fill in the application and contact the family saying what they were missing and what they have turned in. ‘Cause sometimes there was a little bit of a lasp [sic] in communication about who was to tell the parents about what they were missing and things of that nature. Uh I think it worked pretty well. Uh it was definitely a system which could be used in future years. Um – - unfortunately they switch to a different system an online system this year so we dont implement anymore. That was a pretty solid system. s always good to hear. Yeah. ‘K. I think for me – -hm. - um wrist-taking. Risk-taking is probably something I could uh work on. Now I dont mean by risk-taking taking risks just for the sake of risks but being more open to uh trying something Im not uh particularly uh familiar with or uh dont know exactly what the outcome is going to be. Uh its definitely something I could uh give more thought towards. Im generally a conservative person when making decisions and trying to go with um solutions that I can definitely plan out and foresee but I understand that especially in the real world there are times when uh you just dont know whats going to happen with uh later down the line and decisions have to be made. So keeping that in mind um knowing when to take risk and definitely being more open to alternative ways of uh going down a certain path to a solution is something I could uh Id uh Id like to change about myself. d like to have – Mm.- why do you think you should get this job? So uh I think that the biggest one of the biggest qualities in me for me is uh being able to uh being eager and able to learn very quickly. Im a very eager um to learn individual. Ive uh come into internships before not knowing much about the sort of technology and frameworks they use. For example this past summer at my internship at this small company uh I had never used Ruby or many of the JavaScript frameworks they had used before uh and many of the testing frameworks. And I just have to hit the ground running but I think I have a very uh big enthusiasm for learning new things and its one of uh the greatest joys in the world to me is to like go in and just learn uh a new technology and put it into practice. So I think that uh what I may lack for in experience I more than make up for in uh very eager um to learn uh attitude and ability to pick up things pretty quickly in practice. No problem.

97,97,pp45, OK so Im a student here at MIT and I love to study electrical engineering and computer science. Umm you know very quantitatively minded. Im also minoring in mathematics and economics and Im interested in a variety of applications of math and computer science to you know any sort of field that has interesting problems that can bring together a practical application and a use of my technical skill set. Yeah I think so I think I think I have umm I have a talent for being able to identify what motivates people and in organizations its very easy to you know get caught up in whats perceived to be you know? Everyones common motive that the companies supposed to be about. And although the ideal framework would be nice if everyone was working indeed towards the same goal in reality sometimes you know different agents different people in the company different people in the group have different you know slightly different goals for theyre in the game in the first place. And I think by being able to recognize these individual motives and being able to marshal them instead of being a destructive force towards the company being able to marshal everyones individual talents or desires umm as a force that can be used to benefit the company I think this sort of you know deeper deeper attention to what people want is what we- wha- wha- what basically makes me be able to be a you know a good leader by being able to take all the resources that are provided by the team and use the parts to make a good whole sum. I think yeah I uhh yeah I am a team player umm within reason of course. As long as I dont think some ridiculous demand is being made of me. Which is demeaning or its just not useful in terms of it if theres a demand being made of me thats not fulfilled by me and my skill set then I will you know defer to someone else on the team. But given that it is a demand or a request thats made that will tailor itself to my skill set I I think that Im a team player. Umm you know for example Im more skilled at quantitative analysis than people from maybe other backgrounds and there have been many times you know working on group projects and interdisciplinary crafts  where I would be asked to take on some extra role for data analysis just simply because I have more experience in the field. And it would be just more beneficial to the entire to team to have someone who already has more experience. To not have to enter the learning curve at the steepest point umm but instead to be able to produce you know good work pretty quickly. If I were to change one- one thing about myself it would umm it would probably have to be... I guess being umm being more mindful of my time and being a little more meticulous to make sure that all those you know unaccounted for minutes that past by over the course of the day uhh dont add up you know? Into large chunks of time that are being unused. I wish I had a better sense of realizing quickly when my time is not being used optimally and freedom to actually correct that. So I I think that for most jobs and this one as well in a very quantitative field which does also involve you know leading a team of different people from various backgrounds I think that I would be you know uniquely skilled for this job because I do have a strong technical background while I can also take different parts of a team and bring together people with you know they have different motives initially into a coherent unit to get a job done.

Obviously I do think Im a team player. Im trying to think of an example. One specific challenge. The uh for the [??] project you do as a senior. -huh. We had to ah my group was in charge of analysing the materials and we of the section that I got asigned was was ah within our team we did like a self ah splitting it up. And I got like a way way heavy load and somebodies got to really like move. So it was like pretty I didnt know if I should talk to somebody else about it or something like that. And I decided like if we were going to do it as a team. Then were going to have to be on the same page. So at some of my meeting we made sure to split it up a little more evenly. To never have to sleep. Like realistically? Is this like ah... Not going to answer things like that. Uh definitely to be more organized. So a lot of time Ill get like my notes will get messy and stuff like that. Organization. Ive been working on it but its not where it needs to be. Yeah. I do. Uh cause I work well with other groups and this job requires like small groups to work together to accomplish things. -huh. And a small group is like the perfect environment for me to do work that is collaborative but its not like bureaucratic. So so this is like the perfect environment and uh and I have like some experience in the area. But more importantly like I I figure things out and get them done. Like as they need to be so people dont have to tell me what to do or watch over me and stuff like that. Like its if I want something to be accomplished like well work with a team to get it done. Without like somebody telling you or watching you whatever.

100,100,pp49, Good. Its been a tough week. Uhm my name is <inaudible> I am Junior in course 20. Which is Biological Engineering. I come from Puerto Rico. And... Ive been learning a bit more this past year about what I actually want to do in life. Right now my main goals are set more towards the medicine side of Bioengineering. So medical devices biomaterials tissue engineering drug delivery its what its what interests me right now. Uh... its not set right now thats why I am also tending to go to different research opportunities and different uh... pharmaceutical internships and well see what happens from there on. And Ill be able to focus on one actual path per say. So... I think I am leader because I like planning things. I like to gather all the information I have all the resources I have and all the uh... basically either group uh... all the group <inaudible> or each contribution from each person gather them all up and come up with an efficient plan to tackle said problem or homework or project or presentation. Whichever may be the case. I tend to make people give more than... I make them give more than 100% of what the they they the bar that they set themselves at. So I feel if I feel that somebody has potential I can notice it and at the same time work with a person to basically exploit that potential to a new maximum. At the same way I feel that I am very open to constructive criticism if somebody feels that I am not doing a great job I am very happy just to sit with them and learn from that experience because its gonna make me more efficient in the future. So I feel that just having a set plan from the start to tackle problems and at the same way editing it and adapting it to every new situation or the feelings of the people you are basically uh overseeing then thats uh a very good approach to everything that we do. So uh teams have been uh very large aspect of my life. Ever since High School Ive been a part of the Soccer team. I continue to do that now. Ive been part of the debate team and Honor Society which had its own team for competitions. But I feel that the biggest challenge right now has been when I am with a team of people that are seniors to me. So they they are better prepared much better informed and have an arsenal of skills that I have yet to acquire because I just dont have the same level of experience that they have. So if I am Sophomore and Ive been grouped with Seniors and Juniors of my subject of Engineering class the difference is very noticeable. The difference of level and performance is very noticeable. And I try to basically give what I can but I also want to excel at what I can actually move forward to. So if I feel that I can actually contribute much more than what theyre expecting of me because if I dont have that level of experience what I want to do is get to that level. So I gotta work harder push through and get to this level thats basically at the same level as the rest of the group. So Ill try to work with people and Ill try to find someone who mentor me through that process. And step by step because the biggest challenge for me is being alone and tackling it straight Ill use the other group members Ill readily approach them and ask for help because thats what the group is for. The team succeeds together all the way. So... thats I go. I would say doubting. Doubting myself doubting the things I do doubting the decisions I make. I would like to have absolutely no regrets or if I have them learn something from them. I am sometimes am fairly a safe player so I calculate the risks before I see the return. So Im not a great fan of plunging in into something that I dont know thats high risk high return. I like to play it safe and have a thing to fall back on. The same way it works for problems it works for personal life it works for basically everything thats surrounds me. I feel that its been changing with every new experience Ive been passing through. Leaving home college outside of Puerto Rico but I still feel that Ill rarely benefit of just letting go and taking more of a risk than I normally do. The first one that pops right into mind is... Bioengineering. So Ive always been naturally curious about things. Ive always had a drive behind everything I do so I got into Bioengineering right after I saw that I had this opportunity coming to MIT and coming from a family that has been effected by a lot of cancer I found that doing this I could actually benefit my family benefit other peoples families that have been effected by it. Ive been going through some really tough times with grandmothers and other family members that have survived and succumbed to it. And from there my motivation has been always to push forward no matter what the challenge. So when I step into a lab I see what I have in front of me the ultimate goal might be the farthest goal in my life I may never reach it but rest assured that I will do my best to contribute to its forward movement. I will always try and leave it at a better place than it was before and if I am not the one to reach it another person will but I will be sure that I actually contributed to it.,"[' Good.', 'Its been a tough week.', 'Uhm my name is <inaudible> I am Junior in course 20.', 'Which is Biological Engineering.', 'I come from Puerto Rico.', 'And...

101,101,pp5, Alright so my background Im a junior at MIT studying computer science and umm Ive also done research in the computer science field. Umm I interned er I researched with a group at MIT and what we did was we made an interactive game to uh to teach. And Ive also had some experience uh internship at uh at Google. I think Im a leader. I do believe I have leadership uh qualities and that and I can support this because Ive been in leadership positions in organizations here on campus. And when I have had the responsibilities Ive carried them out uh very well and Ive been able to overcome challenges such as umm one of the groups Im uh on the executive board of expedited access to standard education. Umm one of the our tasks this semester was to come up with an idea for a presentation and to carry it out at a control show from another group. And I took complete ownership of that and it came out pretty well and we were able to raise more money than we have in the past. Oh well I definitely would consider myself a team player and an example would be from uh my participation in my team in are student association And for one of the tasks where we were trying to accomplish I was in charge and I thought Id give some tasks to other members and a lot of tasks were not getting completed by the deadline that I set so um as leader to be responsible for that task I tried to figure out what was going on in the other students lives because I was getting context and uh understanding why they were missing deadlines when we didnt have a lot of tests or homework that week. And through that ahem through that understanding I was able to um help motivate them to complete the tasks and resolve that conflict. One thing about myself. Interesting. If I was given the option to change one thing about myself yes? What I would change is to uh I guess uh just generally have a lot more knowledge in my field than I than a person at my level would you know at this kind of level and thats umm thats something that would be nice. You know I feel like I would be able to be uh much further along in my career than I am now. Uh huh yeah. Well I think I should get the job because I um have the skills necessary to complete the the task that Ill be assigned. Um Im very motivated Im always willing to learn and I Im very passionate about learning and uh I think Ill be able to learn a lot through the position as well as contribute to the position and be able to um influence the people that I work directly with or that are shareholders in my project.,"[' Alright so my background Im a junior at MIT studying computer science and umm Ive also done research in the computer science field.', 'Umm I interned er I researched with a group at MIT and what we did was we made an interactive game to uh to teach.', 'And Ive also had some experience uh internship at uh at Google.', 'I think Im a leader.', 'I do believe I have leadership uh qualities and that and I can support this because Ive been in leadership positions in organizations here on campus.', 'And when I have had the responsibilities Ive carried them out uh very well and Ive been able to overcome challenges such as umm one of the groups Im uh on the executive board of expedited access to standard education.', 'Umm one of the our tasks this semester was to come up with an idea for a presentation and to carry it out at a control show from another group.', 'And I took complete ownership of that and it came out pretty well and we were able to raise more money than we have in the past.', 'Oh well I definitely would consider myself a team player and an example would be from uh my participation in my team in are student association And for one of the tasks where we were trying to accomplish I was in charge and I thought Id give some tasks to other members and a lot of tasks were not getting completed by the deadline that I set so um as leader to be responsible for that task I tried to figure out what was going on in the other students lives because I was getting context and uh understanding why they were missing deadlines when we didnt have a lot of tests or homework that week.', 'And through that ahem through that understanding I was able to um help motivate them to complete the tasks and resolve that conflict.', 'One thing about myself.', 'Interesting.', 'If I was given the option to change one thing about myself yes?', 'What I would change is to uh I guess uh just generally have a lot more knowledge in my field than I than a person at my level would you know at this kind of level and thats umm thats something that would be nice.', 'You know I feel like I would be able to be uh much further along in my career than I am now.', 'Uh huh yeah.', 'Well I think I should get the job because I um have the skills necessary to complete the the task that Ill be assigned.', 'Um Im very motivated Im always willing to learn and I Im very passionate about learning and uh I think Ill be able to learn a lot through the position as well as contribute to the position and be able to um influence the people that I work directly with or that are shareholders in my project.']","[array([0.11176778, 0.00894984, 0.25356013, 0.00339238, 0.6223299 ],

102,102,pp50, Very well thanks. My background...uh I have a fiarly technical background. I went to a fairly technical high school. Um I have mainly a mathematics and physics background with also some computer science. Uh I also I have been involved in leadership uh outside of outside of academics. So then in high school I was uh captain of my chess team and I also served as president of a couple of clubs in high school. So I have some some experience in that regard. Like I said mainly I have a pretty quantitative technical background and uh with some sprinkling of other stuff as well. Yes I think so because I typically think using my own mind and I act on those decisions rather than listening to what...uh I mean of course I take into account what... I think it was Lincoln who said that uh you should take into account what people tell you but then make your own decision. He said it more elaborately but those are the essence of what he was saying and I try to I try to to use that in every day life and in also in like important projects. I would say that and I I usually have Im usually pretty successful in convincing people that my way is right when it is. Um yeah I think so. Uh when its a matter of ideology I dont like to make compromises but when its a matter of uh getting stuff done I think that I I think that I am a team player. I think that uh usually Im  Im willing to to make sacrifices if necessary for the ultimate goal. And so for example uh one time in high school uh we had a group project and one of the member I mean it was more complicated than Im making it but the gist of it was that one of the members who was responsible for our data analysis he fell short he uh he we found out pretty late uh just a few days before the presentation that he had misdone most of the data analysis and as a result the rest of us but especially me because it was a group of four and we were kind of divided into two him and me and then subdivided into ones. So he and I were kind of a subgroup of a larger group. And so I was more responsible for what he had done than the other two were. So it was mainly me with some help from the other two. We had to put in a lot of work in those last few days especially me. I had to fix that and try to get it you know get it functional before the presentation was due. (One thing about myself...) I guess maybe being uh being more decisive on incomplete information. I have a tendency to try to make to try to get almost perfect information before I commit a hundred percent to a decision and of course thats never thats not always possible. And so I do I mean I do of course make decisions based on imperfect information every day. You have to otherwise you wouldnt survive. But I feel that you know if there is a spectrum of of how decisive youre willing to be based on a certain amount of information I think the ideal place that I would like to be is a little further toward the the decisive on incomplete information end than where I am right now. So I would shift that a little bit. ok Umm I mean lets go with quantitative trading trading. Well I think I have the necessary skill set and the and the not the personality maybe well personality but more the uh so in terms of skill set you know it takes a very quantitative mathematical background with the ability to implement stuff uh to program and so on and I have all of that. It takes a lot of modelling skills. I have that mathematical modelling and what not. It also requires you to be A  very competitive which I have been and B to be willing to you know to go through hell for for certain periods of time when youre either up next to a deadline or something unexpected happens and... So it requires you to be able to to vary the amount of time you put in usually Ill opt for the higher uh for an increased amount of time a significant bit from the average so I and I think I have a lot of experience doing that and its something that Ive shown I can handle.,"[' Very well thanks.', 'My background...uh I have a fiarly technical background.', 'I went to a fairly technical high school.', 'Um I have mainly a mathematics and physics background with also some computer science.', 'Uh I also I have been involved in leadership uh outside of outside of academics.', 'So then in high school I was uh captain of my chess team and I also served as president of a couple of clubs in high school.', 'So I have some some experience in that regard.', 'Like I said mainly I have a pretty quantitative technical background and uh with some sprinkling of other stuff as well.', 'Yes I think so because I typically think using my own mind and I act on those decisions rather than listening to what...uh I mean of course I take into account what...', 'I think it was Lincoln who said that uh you should take into account what people tell you but then make your own decision.', 'He said it more elaborately but those are the essence of what he was saying and I try to I try to to use that in every day life and in also in like important projects.', 'I would say that and I I usually have Im usually pretty successful in convincing people that my way is right when it is.', 'Um yeah I think so.', 'Uh when its a matter of ideology I dont like to make compromises but when its a matter of uh getting stuff done I think that I I think that I am a team player.', 'I think that uh usually Im  Im willing to to make sacrifices if necessary for the ultimate goal.', 'And so for example uh one time in high school uh we had a group project and one of the member I mean it was more complicated than Im making it but the gist of it was that one of the members who was responsible for our data analysis he fell short he uh he we found out pretty late uh just a few days before the presentation that he had misdone most of the data analysis and as a result the rest of us but especially me because it was a group of four and we were kind of divided into two him and me and then subdivided into ones.', 'So he and I were kind of a subgroup of a larger group.', 'And so I was more responsible for what he had done than the other two were.', 'So it was mainly me with some help from the other two.', 'We had to put in a lot of work in those last few days especially me.', 'I had to fix that and try to get it you know get it functional before the presentation was due.', '(One thing about myself...)

103,103,pp52, Um well Im from Florida. I was born in Miami. My uh parents are from...Im uh South Korean by ethnicity. Id say Im more American by heritage but uh my um parents came around here in the 80s and they settled down. And around I was born like around 90s I was born here in Florida. I had all my schooling in Florida. I went to home school until 7th grade then private school until I graduated. Thats a brief synopsis of my background. I think I am uh just because um I have seniority maybe through sports or if its from...I feel like its hard for people not to be leaders especially when youre um assigned to do group work or youre assigned to do goal setting. I feel like if youre in any uh situation where youre doing goal setting youre being a leader by putting out what tasks you should do and how to execute them. And how you tell like youre telling yourself How am I gonna get this done. So like basically youre self leading. I believe. Um maybe Id say through sports I was probably a leader. By um me being the upperclassman I led my teammates on. So Id say yeah Ive been a leader. Uh yes um. SO seeing how I rowed four years I think the biggest conflict was um when um Junior year I was rowing for Junior Eight for nationals where we were in the grand finals. ANd the last pentameter of the terameter (sp) race my oar popped out and we ended up actually going from third place to dead last in the grand finals. That was possibly the most hard experience because it made me really reevaluate what it meant for me to be rowing especially because thats something I spent four hours a day six days a week on for my entire senior um high school career and that twas something I was going to carry over through to college. And what really um made me realize was that yes like that was a big mistake it was just honestly it could have happened to anyone but if it werent for some people if it werent for just me just being just taking and it and just maturing from it I think thats like what it takes. If you go through something really bad but you can get stronger from it. You can still push something onto the table. Like um last last (?) year and still work hard to to really fight through it. You can really become great. And um I feel like thats what I was really working to change my view on that and um in the end we um we medaled we uh were runner ups in states. We medaled. So I think that was a good good conflict that I resolved. I wish I wish...If I could change one thing about myself I think it would be me being I think more proactive to do something. Id say I wish I was more...I wish I was could I wish I was a little bit more volatile in things I chose actually. Because I feel like um I stuck to just doing crew in high school and I thought that was great but I was wondering like I wondered what would happen to me if I tried different more than one thing. I know I know like its good for people to stick just to one thing and just grow in that field. But I always wondered I always wondered like what would happen if I pursued more toward research or more towards um club activities. That way I could have like a more well-rounded high school experience. One right now or just... Well I think I should have this job mainly because I find that Im well with groups I work very well with groups. At the same time when you push me to do tasks myself Im able to do the same amount be just as productive. I feel like um as an applicant being subject to group work and individual work um there should be no difference in how I should produce something in group work in individual work. I should be just as creative and innovative if I was working myself or if I was spending time working with a group of people. So I feel like if I was going to get this job um it would help greatly for the people Id be working with and for myself. ,"[' Um well Im from Florida.', 'I was born in Miami.', 'My uh parents are from...Im uh South Korean by ethnicity.', 'Id say Im more American by heritage but uh my um parents came around here in the 80s and they settled down.', 'And around I was born like around 90s I was born here in Florida.', 'I had all my schooling in Florida.', 'I went to home school until 7th grade then private school until I graduated.', 'Thats a brief synopsis of my background.', 'I think I am uh just because um I have seniority maybe through sports or if its from...I feel like its hard for people not to be leaders especially when youre um assigned to do group work or youre assigned to do goal setting.', 'I feel like if youre in any uh situation where youre doing goal setting youre being a leader by putting out what tasks you should do and how to execute them.', 'And how you tell like youre telling yourself How am I gonna get this done.', 'So like basically youre self leading.', 'I believe.', 'Um maybe Id say through sports I was probably a leader.', 'By um me being the upperclassman I led my teammates on.', 'So Id say yeah Ive been a leader.', 'Uh yes um.', 'SO seeing how I rowed four years I think the biggest conflict was um when um Junior year I was rowing for Junior Eight for nationals where we were in the grand finals.', 'ANd the last pentameter of the terameter (sp) race my oar popped out and we ended up actually going from third place to dead last in the grand finals.', 'That was possibly the most hard experience because it made me really reevaluate what it meant for me to be rowing especially because thats something I spent four hours a day six days a week on for my entire senior um high school career and that twas something I was going to carry over through to college.', 'And what really um made me realize was that yes like that was a big mistake it was just honestly it could have happened to anyone but if it werent for some people if it werent for just me just being just taking and it and just maturing from it I think thats like what it takes.', 'If you go through something really bad but you can get stronger from it.', 'You can still push something onto the table.', 'Like um last last (?)', 'year and still work hard to to really fight through it.', 'You can really become great.', 'And um I feel like thats what I was really working to change my view on that and um in the end we um we medaled we uh were runner ups in states.', 'We medaled.', 'So I think that was a good good conflict that I resolved.', 'I wish I wish...If I could change one thing about myself I think it would be me being I think more proactive to do something.', 'Id say I wish I was more...I wish I was could I wish I was a little bit more volatile in things I chose actually.', 'Because I feel like um I stuck to just doing crew in high school and I thought that was great but I was wondering like I wondered what would happen to me if I tried different more than one thing.', 'I know I know like its good for people to stick just to one thing and just grow in that field.', 'But I always wondered I always wondered like what would happen if I pursued more toward research or more towards um club activities.', 'That way I could have like a more well-rounded high school experience.', 'One right now or just...

Uhmm so I was born in uh Nigeria uh and I actually came over to the united states when I was 8 years old.uhmm and uhm basically like most of my family members are actually not in the medical field so it was kind like I actually dont know what got my initial interest in the medical field. But uh I remember science math math and science were always my best subjects. Uhm and I really enjoy anatomy human anatomy. Uhm so I think thats when i started thinking about medical field.Uhm and uhm after being able to shadow uhm a neonatologist in high school I think thats when I kind of figured this like i want to work in pediatrics and plus I love kids as well. Thats when I really figured out thats what I wanted to do. Left-right? I do beleive Im a leader. Uhm I do beleive I take initiative a lot. Uhm one example that is uhm one of the student groups that I work with I work with several actually but one of uhm an example from one the one that I work with is our black women alliance. Uhm Im on the executive board. But my role is pretty uh Its kind of almost in the shadows. Uh Im on the social committee. So Im the representative for my class. uhm and uhm I tend to kind of like I guess because Im more of an upperclassmen I can tend to just throw ideas and get people thinking uhm rather then you know I guess direct people. I think Im more of like an Initiator uhm  then I let people ya know just do what they want with whatever it is they throw out there. Yes I do believe I am a leader. Um yes i do beleive Im a team player. Uh another student that I work with I work with several that I can mention. Uhm are black student union and Im on the executive board of for the second time this year uhmand Im co-chair uhm this year and uhm our executive board is pretty unique. Uhm even though I havent titled in co-chair uhm every member on the e-board has a really even role.So its really even split as far as like what we have uhm our responsibilities are and how much our opinions weigh. uhm and um actually this current executive voard we had some rocky start at the beginning of the year. uhm there was a lot of loss of communication uhm things werent getting done in a timely fashion. We werent really making progress. uhm  collectively. Individually we were fine but collectively we werent really moving forward. Uhm But Uhm we A few of us noticed that fact that we werent communicating and uhm we actually thought it would be a good idea to kind of have like a like a de-breifing session where we kind of express you know what is wrong exactlly. Uhm and how we can move forward andwe found out that ya know that we have to find a way to kind of communicate more even if its just sending a breif text every now and then saying what you are doing. Uhm We should definitely communicate more often then we were doing. Anduh yes weve been able to communicate more more then some we definitely we definitely have a long way to go but were increasing communication uh right now and uh were doing much better. And were making a lot of progress now. If I was given one option to change one thing about myself Uh I think it would be my hesitation. Uhm Im pretty hesitant uhm about you know uhm first ideas or initial thoughts that I have. Uhm I like always have to seek like a second opinion. Or Ill have to talk it out with someone or sometimes I dont even talk about it all because um I get maybe shy. I wouldnt exactly call myself shy but I guess when it comes to some opinions I might have im really hesitant about sharing. Uhm and thats one thing Id definitely like to change because some most of the time people say oh your idea was actually really cool. And Im just like wow really? So I guess I kind of doubt myself a lot.  I think thats something that Id really like to change. Because it hinders me a lot. Uhm I would really I think its something I need to work on. And I guess uhm A way to improve that would again doing more of the talking to people about how they feel about my idea. They think its a good idea uhm and it has helped a little bit in the past but I need to work on that some more. I think I should get into medical school uhm because I do believe that I will make a good doctor. um Im a people person I love helping people. um and I love kids um I love seeing um I guess their resilience when it comes to their health. Um how they can just um ya know get better so quickly compared to adults. um and I want to I guess  um bring the knowledge that i gained from MIT um into the medical fiwld. Um whether its through ya know drugs different drug discoveries and things like that and drug trials. Or um even if its just ya know um kind of like the collaborative spirit we have at MIT campus bringing it to a hospital setting.. setting uhm because I know a lot of hospitals have just like a barrier

105,105,pp55, Yeah sure. Ummm Im great. Thank you. OK well I am a math major but I have a lot of background in kind of different areas. So freshman year I did some work um at the Department of Energy um working the CFOs office so Im getting kind of a feel for the budget um also risk matrices. Then I kinda branched more towards CS aspects so I did a bit of coding here and there in most research aspects and also um for companies. Ummm definitely. So Im president of The Undergrad Society of Learner Math and this basically gives me a great opportunity to um kind of help underclassmen and also younger girls so those in highschool middle school and kind of get them to become more active in the math community um participate in more events even networking things so uh anything with companies but also research with professors. Its a great way to kind of help other people who havent really seen those opportunities yet. Yeah soum last winter I was working in the Boston area at Autotegrity which is like a online marketing start up. um  I dont know how much familiarity you have with um coding like repository systems but basically if someone um uploads like their work to the server and it doesnt work basically everyone elses stuff doesnt work either. So theres like a little column button type thing in rebuild which is called the blame button so you could kind of blame people. So every once in a while it would occur where someone would screw up the code and that would make everyones work stop instead of you know blaming the one person telling them to fix the code we would all kind of look at where it went wrong and how we could improve upon that further instead of just fixing one persons code. So it was kind of a group effort to see how much we could all improve from the one mistake. I guess I would probably try to ask more questions. Um in general if I get directions which are really broad where I dont know where to start searching um instead of asking my higher up i would probably just automatically start looking at everything and start floating around. I guess it would be good to get more like to the point. Um like I mentioned before i think I have a good combination of leadership skills as well as um team player abilities. In addition to this I am pretty qualified I believe in terms of my academic classes that I have taken and also my extracurriculars have demonstrated I have a deep passion for math. And aside from that I have many internships which have honed my skills in the work place.,"[' Yeah sure.', 'Ummm Im great.', 'Thank you.', 'OK well I am a math major but I have a lot of background in kind of different areas.', 'So freshman year I did some work um at the Department of Energy um working the CFOs office so Im getting kind of a feel for the budget um also risk matrices.', 'Then I kinda branched more towards CS aspects so I did a bit of coding here and there in most research aspects and also um for companies.', 'Ummm definitely.', 'So Im president of The Undergrad Society of Learner Math and this basically gives me a great opportunity to um kind of help underclassmen and also younger girls so those in highschool middle school and kind of get them to become more active in the math community um participate in more events even networking things so uh anything with companies but also research with professors.', 'Its a great way to kind of help other people who havent really seen those opportunities yet.', 'Yeah soum last winter I was working in the Boston area at Autotegrity which is like a online marketing start up.', 'um  I dont know how much familiarity you have with um coding like repository systems but basically if someone um uploads like their work to the server and it doesnt work basically everyone elses stuff doesnt work either.', 'So theres like a little column button type thing in rebuild which is called the blame button so you could kind of blame people.', 'So every once in a while it would occur where someone would screw up the code and that would make everyones work stop instead of you know blaming the one person telling them to fix the code we would all kind of look at where it went wrong and how we could improve upon that further instead of just fixing one persons code.', 'So it was kind of a group effort to see how much we could all improve from the one mistake.', 'I guess I would probably try to ask more questions.', 'Um in general if I get directions which are really broad where I dont know where to start searching um instead of asking my higher up i would probably just automatically start looking at everything and start floating around.', 'I guess it would be good to get more like to the point.', 'Um like I mentioned before i think I have a good combination of leadership skills as well as um team player abilities.', 'In addition to this I am pretty qualified I believe in terms of my academic classes that I have taken and also my extracurriculars have demonstrated I have a deep passion for math.', 'And aside from that I have many internships which have honed my skills in the work place.']","[array([0.03120919, 0.00352396, 0.00100134, 0.00189352, 0.962372  ],

106,106,pp56,  Im good how are you? Um Im currently a junior at MIT studying Biology. Im interested in going to medical school so Im hoping to apply to medical school my senior year and then matriculate the next year. Um yeah. Um I think Im a leader. I have a lot of leadership positions so currently I am the President of the student group at MIT called the American Medical Student Association. -hmm. So uh I help organize a lot of events for pre-meds at MIT um so as a pre-med I feel there arent very many resources um for pre-meds. We have a pre-med advising office but um most students at MIT end up going into like Engineering or Research not very many go into medicine. So um we provide a lot of um outside activities for pre-meds. Uh our main one is um lecture series so we often ask Doctors from nearby hospitals to come speak about like what they do. Sure um so um as part of the American Medical Student Association uh last year we started a brand new event um it was a 5k run to benefit the Austins Childrens Hospital. And since it was our first time planning such a large event we had a lot of trouble um like communicating between team members and distributing um what like clearly stating what each person should do and what their responsibilities were. Um to fix that I think we had to like I had to call like an Executive meeting. So we have an Exec Board and then uh I made sure that everyone knew clearly what they were supposed to do and made sure they finished what they had to do by a certain date. Hmm thats tough. (Laughter) Um I think the main thing I would try to change is um getting nervous in front of strangers or being shy um I used to um get really shy when like public speaking for example speaking in front of a lot of people and Ive been trying to improve that. Um but I think it would be nice if I could be more but like there is still room for improvement. Uh my passion is helping people. So I have a lot of Ive been doing a lot of volunteer activities um Ive been volunteering at hospitals Ive been volunteering at Brooks I bring them to the Womens Hospital in Boston and MEPS General Hospital. Ive also been volunteering through the Cambridge Community Centers I used to tutor young children how to read and Im currently an AP Biology Teacher for um students in the Boston area who want to take AP Biology but cant. Um so I really enjoy helping people uh and I think medicine is one of the best ways to help people because everyone gets sick and uh I mean once your health is gone you cant really do anything so...,"['  Im good how are you?', 'Um Im currently a junior at MIT studying Biology.', 'Im interested in going to medical school so Im hoping to apply to medical school my senior year and then matriculate the next year.', 'Um yeah.', 'Um I think Im a leader.', 'I have a lot of leadership positions so currently I am the President of the student group at MIT called the American Medical Student Association.', '-hmm.', 'So uh I help organize a lot of events for pre-meds at MIT um so as a pre-med I feel there arent very many resources um for pre-meds.', 'We have a pre-med advising office but um most students at MIT end up going into like Engineering or Research not very many go into medicine.', 'So um we provide a lot of um outside activities for pre-meds.', 'Uh our main one is um lecture series so we often ask Doctors from nearby hospitals to come speak about like what they do.', 'Sure um so um as part of the American Medical Student Association uh last year we started a brand new event um it was a 5k run to benefit the Austins Childrens Hospital.', 'And since it was our first time planning such a large event we had a lot of trouble um like communicating between team members and distributing um what like clearly stating what each person should do and what their responsibilities were.', 'Um to fix that I think we had to like I had to call like an Executive meeting.', 'So we have an Exec Board and then uh I made sure that everyone knew clearly what they were supposed to do and made sure they finished what they had to do by a certain date.', 'Hmm thats tough.', '(Laughter) Um I think the main thing I would try to change is um getting nervous in front of strangers or being shy um I used to um get really shy when like public speaking for example speaking in front of a lot of people and Ive been trying to improve that.', 'Um but I think it would be nice if I could be more but like there is still room for improvement.', 'Uh my passion is helping people.', 'So I have a lot of Ive been doing a lot of volunteer activities um Ive been volunteering at hospitals Ive been volunteering at Brooks I bring them to the Womens Hospital in Boston and MEPS General Hospital.', 'Ive also been volunteering through the Cambridge Community Centers I used to tutor young children how to read and Im currently an AP Biology Teacher for um students in the Boston area who want to take AP Biology but cant.', 'Um so I really enjoy helping people uh and I think medicine is one of the best ways to help people because everyone gets sick and uh I mean once your health is gone you cant really do anything so...']","[array([0.23260541, 0.00101473, 0.00569431, 0.00083825, 0.75984734],

107,107,pp57, Im doing very well today. Thanks. How are you? Im currently a Junior here at MIT and Im pursing a double major in Computer Science and Management um the reason for that is that I actually fell in love with um the merging of computer science with a lot of other fields and I found that management is a way to take computer science and the theories of algorithms and problem solving and taking it to a wider field which is exactly why Im interested in consulting is again its the idea of taking problem solving and algorithms and applying it to a lot of different problems and always trying new things and Im very excited about that and thats where Im coming from I do. Um Im actually a part of the Gordan Engineering leadership program here at MIT which students are chosen through an application process to be a part of this program and in this program um we work on engineering leadership labs which is um they give us scenarios which we might encounter in the real world and we take the position of a leader and kind of get to step through it and Ive gotten very positive feedback from my group every time about how Ive handled those. In addition in um various activities Im involved in on campus I have had a leadership role in many of those and again Ive gotten very positive feedback from the people Ive worked with so I think those put together mean not only have I had the experience to be a leader but Ive also had positive feedback that I am succeeding at that. Definitely! Um I was on the committee that designed our class ring so at MIT each year theres a new class ring designed specifically for that year and the idea is that it enco..encompasses aspects of all different fractions of student life so this committee is made up of a very diverse group of people. And um there were some features on the ring which we would become very divided on and there few ah divisions within campus which kind of became clear on our team so people would kind of polarize based on which side of the campus fraction they lived on and then it would kind of get a little bit hostile and people would say this is relevant no its not relevant um and I kind of became the peace keeper um where I would kind of go between those sides try to find the mutually agreeable thing maybe like if someone really wanted something on the ring and someone else didnt I would suggest maybe we could make it smaller or have it somewhere else so if it was on the ring but not so blatantly obvious that the people who didnt relate to it thought it was too focal so I became kind of the unofficial go between who would hear both sides kind of impartially and put things together...and I had about 2 to 3 people afterwards tell me that we wouldnt have gotten to where we did without my peacekeeping. I think I would know my limits a little bit better. Um in that sense I like I mentioned with the computer science and management I get excited in a lot of different areas and I really want to try doing everything that excites me and I really give it my all but as a result being involved with a lot of different things means that at times I very tired because Im trying to do a lot so I think I would recognize when Im hitting that point and scale back a little bit um that said Ive been trying to work on that a bit this year and kind of pick my top activities and cut down to those so it is something Im working on. I think aside from my background which is as I mentioned very ah relevant to consulting with the library and gym applications um as weve talked about Im very much a team player Im very excited about the work that you do um I absolutely love all the different aspects Ive talked to a lot of people in the company and Ive really liked what theyve said about the company culture it makes me very excited and those are all values I struggle and relate to so in addition to the expertise I think I would be a great fit.,"[' Im doing very well today.', 'Thanks.', 'How are you?', 'Im currently a Junior here at MIT and Im pursing a double major in Computer Science and Management um the reason for that is that I actually fell in love with um the merging of computer science with a lot of other fields and I found that management is a way to take computer science and the theories of algorithms and problem solving and taking it to a wider field which is exactly why Im interested in consulting is again its the idea of taking problem solving and algorithms and applying it to a lot of different problems and always trying new things and Im very excited about that and thats where Im coming from I do.', 'Um Im actually a part of the Gordan Engineering leadership program here at MIT which students are chosen through an application process to be a part of this program and in this program um we work on engineering leadership labs which is um they give us scenarios which we might encounter in the real world and we take the position of a leader and kind of get to step through it and Ive gotten very positive feedback from my group every time about how Ive handled those.', 'In addition in um various activities Im involved in on campus I have had a leadership role in many of those and again Ive gotten very positive feedback from the people Ive worked with so I think those put together mean not only have I had the experience to be a leader but Ive also had positive feedback that I am succeeding at that.', 'Definitely!', 'Um I was on the committee that designed our class ring so at MIT each year theres a new class ring designed specifically for that year and the idea is that it enco..encompasses aspects of all different fractions of student life so this committee is made up of a very diverse group of people.', 'And um there were some features on the ring which we would become very divided on and there few ah divisions within campus which kind of became clear on our team so people would kind of polarize based on which side of the campus fraction they lived on and then it would kind of get a little bit hostile and people would say this is relevant no its not relevant um and I kind of became the peace keeper um where I would kind of go between those sides try to find the mutually agreeable thing maybe like if someone really wanted something on the ring and someone else didnt I would suggest maybe we could make it smaller or have it somewhere else so if it was on the ring but not so blatantly obvious that the people who didnt relate to it thought it was too focal so I became kind of the unofficial go between who would hear both sides kind of impartially and put things together...and I had about 2 to 3 people afterwards tell me that we wouldnt have gotten to where we did without my peacekeeping.', 'I think I would know my limits a little bit better.', 'Um in that sense I like I mentioned with the computer science and management I get excited in a lot of different areas and I really want to try doing everything that excites me and I really give it my all but as a result being involved with a lot of different things means that at times I very tired because Im trying to do a lot so I think I would recognize when Im hitting that point and scale back a little bit um that said Ive been trying to work on that a bit this year and kind of pick my top activities and cut down to those so it is something Im working on.', 'I think aside from my background which is as I mentioned very ah relevant to consulting with the library and gym applications um as weve talked about Im very much a team player Im very excited about the work that you do um I absolutely love all the different aspects Ive talked to a lot of people in the company and Ive really liked what theyve said about the company culture it makes me very excited and those are all values I struggle and relate to so in addition to the expertise I think I would be a great fit.']","[array([0.75663686, 0.01113916, 0.04710728, 0.00258806, 0.18252861],

108,108,pp58, Good. I study ocean engineering at MIT. Im a junior and Im really interested in building robots to use in the ocean. Like this summer I worked on an underwater vehicle to look at sea ice in Antarctica. re a leader? Tell me why. Yes I believe Im a leader. Right now um one of my main leadership initiatives is restarting the Society of Naval Architects Submarine Engineers at MIT. And thats a group of all the ocean engineers studying at MIT including undergrads and grad-students. And um Im working with other students to organize dinners with professors and outings with with students interested in engineering from other schools and departments. Yes Id say Im a team player. Uhm this this term Im working on a team for one of my classes. A team of about seven people and were building er manufacturing a hundred yo-yos together and um its actually complicated to manufacture one yo-yo if youre doing everything from scratch like the molds the plastic the process times you figuring out which missions you want to use. And um weve done a yo-yo we decided to divide our team into um groups of two people and each set of two people works on one part of the yo-yo so we have four parts. And we were having a problem just last week when we needed to fill out a report about our yo-yos but two teams hadnt finished their part yet because they couldnt um get time in the mission shop so we decided to resolve that by we talked to the professor I was the person who talked to the professor and asked for an extension on the report and told him what was happening. Uhm we got the extention and anyway if we wrote the report except missing the information from those two parts and then the team working on those two parts is going to fill it in this week. Lets see. Sometimes I would like to be more comfortable with my voice. Like speaking louder and more confidently.  Sometimes like when I go back home I pick up this southern accent again. My family lives in D.C. but a lot are from the south and they speak with the twang so when I came home for Thanksgiving I had this southern twang. Oh it sounded different and people were a little bit confused and then I went into this middle stage now Im back to where I am now. Maybe speaking a little bit more quieter but without the accent. So I need to find out where my voice is.  Uhm I am a really hard worker Im very organized Im comfortable working with teams. Im also on a sealing team which is another part of a team that Im involved on. Um Im passionate about what I do and I can bring a lot of engineering expertise and knowledge into the group.,"[' Good.', 'I study ocean engineering at MIT.', 'Im a junior and Im really interested in building robots to use in the ocean.', 'Like this summer I worked on an underwater vehicle to look at sea ice in Antarctica.', 're a leader?', 'Tell me why.', 'Yes I believe Im a leader.', 'Right now um one of my main leadership initiatives is restarting the Society of Naval Architects Submarine Engineers at MIT.', 'And thats a group of all the ocean engineers studying at MIT including undergrads and grad-students.', 'And um Im working with other students to organize dinners with professors and outings with with students interested in engineering from other schools and departments.', 'Yes Id say Im a team player.', 'Uhm this this term Im working on a team for one of my classes.', 'A team of about seven people and were building er manufacturing a hundred yo-yos together and um its actually complicated to manufacture one yo-yo if youre doing everything from scratch like the molds the plastic the process times you figuring out which missions you want to use.', 'And um weve done a yo-yo we decided to divide our team into um groups of two people and each set of two people works on one part of the yo-yo so we have four parts.', 'And we were having a problem just last week when we needed to fill out a report about our yo-yos but two teams hadnt finished their part yet because they couldnt um get time in the mission shop so we decided to resolve that by we talked to the professor I was the person who talked to the professor and asked for an extension on the report and told him what was happening.', 'Uhm we got the extention and anyway if we wrote the report except missing the information from those two parts and then the team working on those two parts is going to fill it in this week.', 'Lets see.', 'Sometimes I would like to be more comfortable with my voice.', 'Like speaking louder and more confidently.', 'Sometimes like when I go back home I pick up this southern accent again.', 'My family lives in D.C. but a lot are from the south and they speak with the twang so when I came home for Thanksgiving I had this southern twang.', 'Oh it sounded different and people were a little bit confused and then I went into this middle stage now Im back to where I am now.', 'Maybe speaking a little bit more quieter but without the accent.', 'So I need to find out where my voice is.', 'Uhm I am a really hard worker Im very organized Im comfortable working with teams.', 'Im also on a sealing team which is another part of a team that Im involved on.', 'Um Im passionate about what I do and I can bring a lot of engineering expertise and knowledge into the group.']","[array([2.5457432e-02, 1.0670138e-03, 1.0337941e-03, 8.8544219e-04,

109,109,pp59, Great hahaha. More about my backround well... Im from Canada but I grew up in South Florida because you know one day my parents just decided that it was too cold *interviewer laughs* so they literally just decided to pick up and move. Uhh so I basically lived there my whole life until I decided to come here for school and you know since then Ive just been going through MIT... Im trying to do a lot of pre-med things. I like to volunteer. Uhhh you know strong family values things like that. So... Yes. Because umm everything I try to do I you know always try to do the best that I can and even if Im not the best at it that-- the effort like that alone should be enough to sort of inspire somebody even if theyre better at it than I am you know. I find thats inspiring you know seeing someone try you know and trying their hardest. And maybe theyre not the best at it but you know the effort that they put into something is sort of something to be looked high upon so... *hushed laughter* Umm sure. Sooo basically almost every night when you go home to problem set... You know problems sets here are sort of designed to be group efforts at least in chemical engineering they are and often you and your group are working and you come to a crossroads you know part of the group thinks you should go one wan and part of the gorup things we should go another way. And you know kind of something that Ive learned is that you cant shut down other peoples ideas... Umm so I think something really important to do is... WE end up trying both ways and maybe it takes us a little blt more effot and maybe it takes us a little bit longer but then we know for sure like you know Okay this way definitely didnt work and you know maybe this way is the better way to go... but at least we didnt just you know diverge one way and think like Oh maybe we should have done it another way so I think thats pretty important. Umm hmmm. I wish I was taller *both laugh*. You know sometimes I guess I always think that you know Im right and you know it takes people some convincing and I--I know Im definitely not right all the time but I think thats kind of you know like human nature like no-one ever wants to think that theyre wrong  but uhh you know something Ive learned here is youre not always right and everyone here is pretty smart and they also have some really good ideas and its really important to sort of take into account what others are thinking and you know thats just sort of the best way to progress at least in our work here its... No-one could ever finish something for example the problem sets like I was talking about before you cant finish a problem set by yourself. You need to get input from other people and like becoming open-minded was definitely like a challenge for me but its something that Ive been working on and something I think Ive definitely got a lot better at since coming to MIT at least so... Heh ha because Ive been working my but off *both laugh* Umm you know its just something that Im very passionate about. Im really not... I would do it for free like Im you know people say they want to do medicine for the money or you know cause its a high-power career but you know  its the only type of thing... and... that I see myself being satisfied with in a long-term career. Its... I love being part of like the medical community right now you know if its my work between being an EMT working at the hospital... you know working as a tech... These are all things that I would love and I would do. Im happy to wake up in the morning and go do these things and you know I wanna say its like my burning passion like it is you know my drive and you know I think thats probably the most important thing when youre looking for a candidate for medical school or for a job. Umm its knowing that you know theyre not gonna you know one day decide that they dont wanna do this anymore and theyre not kind of like Yeah Im not sure if I wanna go to med school. Its like no Ive been wanting to do this since I was like nine years old and every single thing Ive done to work my way towards it... its just made me fall in love with it even more.,"[' Great hahaha.', 'More about my backround well...

110,110,pp6, Um so I was born in Japan um where I lived for seven years. After that I moved to uh the U.S. when I was around seven or eight years old. Uh first to Michigan for a couple of years from two to three and then to Maryland um and it was in Maryland that I started middle school. And it was through middle school and high school that I was exposed to above average and advanced courses in science math and uh programming. I was competing with I think the best in the state and probably best in the nation taking math competitions just doing a lot of science competitions in general. Um junior year of high school uh because of peer and parental pressures I decided to go into premed. And I decided to take consequently decided to take some bio classes uh a lot of cell physiology genetics psychology. And when I got here at MIT uh well logically I decided to major in course twenty bio engineering. Um and to just to follow that track I decided to take a couple decided to do a couple internships in labs four labs actually two in academia here at MIT actually and I realized that uh the positions werent fast paced and werent competitive enough or quantitative enough for that matter so I decided to go into industry hoping that would satisfy my requirements I guess. And again it was fun I learned a lot but it was just uh it didnt have the skill set requirements that I wanted. Uh but it was um my last internship I had the opportunity to talk with several directors managers people on the business side I realized that could be something that I want to do. That could be more appropriate for me for my career. Um afterward I talked to a lot of my finance colleagues started taking finance classes went to workshops started networking and I realized you know this is most likely what I want to do. I talked to several people who wanted to go into trading and they gave me some interview questions and I said you know what thats exactly the kind of questions that I want to tackle on a daily basis. And so thats why Im here. Do I think Im a leader? I believe so. And this is I say so because of several reasons. One is from just from personal experience in the past. Ive uh worked in teams Ive met teams a few in high school and a few in college and I think I work well with others. But not only that people trust me. I am able to divide up a huge project break it down into small sub-projects and uh give assign these tasks to different people without uh any complaints without too much complaints. I think I have some leaderships skills uh as you can see from my resume if (inaudible mumbling). I do consider myself a team player. Id like to give a good example. In my sophomore year in high school I worked with this project called Mission Impossible or Mission Possible sorry and the goal of the project was to design a rover from scratch that would traverse a platform and record data send it over to the computer and the computer will create a 3D graph a 3D replica of the terrain. And we were graded on how precise and accurate how similar the 3D terrain was to the actual terrain. And there were many parts to the project one was the construction of the actual rover. The other was the programming. Making us write the source code. Third one was making the terrain. The forth one was integrating everything together. There were five group members there were only four tasks. I was picked to be I guess the group leader so I assigned the tasks. I made sure everything integrated correctly. And its not a small task but uh it definitely gave me some experience. I think one of the problems was because this was a four week long project this was a four week long project but we didnt get much done until the third or forth week because things just didnt integrate correctly. There werent communications there werent assigned tasks there just wasnt teamwork. There just wasnt the synergy that was required for us in order for us to finish this project. And during the third week I was appointed the captain I gave tasks. I made sure every part was compatible. I made sure that everybody knew what everybody else was doing and in the end we completed the project successfully. Well as you can see from my resume my biggest weakness I think is my lack of formal training in finance. Uh Im not a course fifteen finance or management major or a course fourteen economics major. I dont have any form of work experience I dont work in a big bank or investment company or a proprietary trading firm. But I can tell you that I have taken more initiative Ive been more proactive in the last year in terms of looking for ways to combat to overcome my weakness. Ive gone to network sessions Ive actually set up to quit my sports team so I could go to these network sections info sessions workshops because unfortunately team practice was always between five and seven and that was also the period in which info sessions were held. I did my research Ive gone online and went to your company website I know exactly who you guys and what youre looking for I know exactly what my role will be. I dont have any false expectations about my job. And after knowing everything I am still very very very interested in the position. Well I I think my answer to the past question about uh how I overcame at my weakness how one of my strength is my quantitative competitive and fast paced abilities and the fact that I dont have any false expectations I know exactly what I want to do I know exactly what you want from me. And those are very good reasons like they apply to this. And I would also like to compare myself with the rest competition and tell you that I have more I dont think theres anybody else with the same kind of technical strength technical expertise that I have um even uh most students here at MIT.,"[' Um so I was born in Japan um where I lived for seven years.', 'After that I moved to uh the U.S. when I was around seven or eight years old.', 'Uh first

111,111,pp60, Good! How are you? Um so Im a junior at MIT studying computer science and molecular biology. Um most of my background is in biology. I did research for about a year and a half at a lab here at MIT in just basic molecular biology. Um but Im also involved in a couple student groups on campus. One of them I was previously involved in MIT Fighting World Hunger so we did a lot of charity work with local and international hunger issues and trying to learn more about the issues. And right now Ive devoted all of my time to a different organization called GlobeMed at MIT and we basically our partner is a nonprofit organization abroad and we do work to improve HIV healthcare services in Togo which is in Africa. Most people dont know where that is so. I think uh if Im not now I think I have the potential to be one. Um I still consider myself immature as in Im still a student but I think I have been given a couple of leadership positions that Ive grown a lot from um and I think if I was given if I was put in a different situation I could adapt to it. Um would you like an example of a... Um so uh Im co-president of the organization I just mentioned GlobeMed at MIT. And we uh basically are in charge me and my fellow co-president are in charge of about 30 other members. Um and this involves a lot of coordination among teams that we have split. Weve organized our organization into different teams and weve got like campaigns which is like fundraising team and weve got communications is like publicity finances and community building and these are all like split up at the same time we also have to maintain contact with our partner organization abroad in Togo. Um so we do a lot with like non-profit business as well as marketing but also sort of try to appeal to the undergraduate population in terms of fundraising but also awareness. So its kind of pretty multi faceted I think Ive done a lot in terms of building up this organization it started from scratch essentially so. And if you wanted examples of leaderships I guess I could... the only objective thing would be like what weve accomplished so far would that be interesting to you? Um so uh so we started this year essentially and we were able to secure a lot of sponsorships from different companies such as City Sports Dunkin Donuts Copy Tech as well as MIT sponsorships like the public service center where they would give us about $3000 to do our project in January in Togo. And an MIT office donated 62 laptops just this last week. So I think like weve been definitely doing well like getting our name out there and also um achieving what weve set out to do which is improve healthcare. Um well the project hasnt essentially started but our mission was to provide technology to improve clinical efficiency there. So um having our first step sort of been made by securing these donations I think is a good step of us showing that we have been succeeding objectively but but yeah. Um yes so I do think Ive definitely learned a lot from this experiment experience to become more of a team player. And I think I uh I know what it takes to be a good team player by seeing what doesnt work what does work qualities that I dont think work in other members in interactions that Ive had. So an example would be uh last year when GlobeMed first started I wasnt the co-president but we had a set of co-presidents who were also starting out. So to be fair it was a totally new concept new organization and its their downfall is they werent that motivated. They didnt really seem to care that much about the outcome of our organization. And for me and other members that really devoted ourselves to it it really frustrated us um but we had to learn how to be team players in the sense that we couldnt just go out and do everything ourselves and risk stepping on their toes. We had to respect their position as our bosses essentially. And this definitely was difficult in a lot of ways I think I learned that you have to know your bounds and know that you cant achieve everything. You cant always just brute force your way through things. I think that um its always the best way if you ever feel like any conflict is about to arise or if you feel uncomfortable at something like immediately schedule a time to meet with that person just talk it out completely respectfully without approaching a bunch of people and asking what they think. Its just probably better to meet face to face with that person and settle it from the start. And then you know if things dont improve after that there may be other things you can do involving other members but I think its best just face to face yeah so much of our world is like by e-mail nowadays so yeah. In terms of leadership? Or anything? Oh. Hm. Well my joke would be I wish I was taller but hahaha. Well I wish I was more I guess I would change my like time management skills. Because I think I definitely am not as efficient as Id like to be right now especially as a student. Um I think I spend a lot of time on Facebook. I do a lot of networking which I think I justify to myself like Oh thats good for future endeavors  but I really think I like I could be more efficient in terms of like you know my free time in the summer like learn a new programming language. Like that could be thats always something I wanted to do but never end up doing. So so yeah I would probably change that. Uh I think Im very like motivated. I think because I know how to act as a leader of a group. I may not be the most experienced in software development since I just started the major. I think I can direct a team of people very diverse from me and working very different from me because I think Im a very vocal person. I think I communicate well uh with people or attemptfully. And I think that can be useful when its a team. And I think software development like a lot of people think like its just one person in a group programming but I think it really involves a lot of coordination among the team. I think I can contribute that way.,"[' Good!', 'How are you?', 'Um so Im a junior at MIT studying computer science and molecular biology.', 'Um most of my background is in biology.', 'I did research for about a year and a half at a lab here at MIT in just basic molecular biology.', 'Um but Im also involved in a couple student groups on campus.', 'One of them I was previously involved in MIT Fighting World Hunger so we did a lot of charity work with local and international hunger issues and trying to learn more about the issues.', 'And right now Ive devoted all of my time to a different organization called GlobeMed at MIT and we basically our partner is a nonprofit organization abroad and we do work to improve HIV healthcare services in Togo which is in Africa.', 'Most people dont know where that is so.', 'I think uh if Im not now I think I have the potential to be one.', 'Um I still consider myself immature as in Im still a student but I think I have been given a couple of leadership positions that Ive grown a lot from um and I think if I was given if I was put in a different situation I could adapt to it.', 'Um would you like an example of a...

112,112,pp61, Im doing well thank you. “Laughs” O ok. Umm. My name is Victoria Mcray (sp) and Im an Aerospace Engineer at MIT. I am a Junior and Im in NRTC (sp) witch is a Naval training program that you take during college to commission as an officer. re a leader? Tell me why. I would say I am a leader in training at this moment. Umm through ROTC I am put in leadership rolls reach semester. Which help ahh build the skills towards becoming a leader. “quite white noise” Great. And do you consider yourself a team player. Can you give me an example when there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it? Umm last semester I was a squad leader in ROTC…hua … which is where you lead about “coughs” six to eight people umm and you all have to work as a unit to earn ahh honor squad at the end of semester. hua Which is dependent on upon umm our PT scores which we have competitive… PT being Physical Training umm…hua …we have different physical competitions each week. We also have Naval Knowledge quizzes etcetera in working together. Umm and we had sometimes the freshman are a little umm getting use to it a little slower in to getting to the…hua …swing of things. Umm and we have this one who is having issues with PT so I helped have extra sessions to help umm do more physical fitness and…hua …ended up doing a lot better towards the end. s great. Ok. If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be? My command presence.

113,113,pp62, Im good. Okay so I was born in Irvine California um where I lived for about ten years. And um my parents and I actually moved back to Taiwan um at that point. So I went to an international school there. Um. It was mostly English speaking but outside of school I would often speak Mandarin also with a couple of friends um as well as you know just getting by in the outside world. Yeah and so yeah so when I was after high school I decided to apply to colleges in the U.S. Um just because I was more interested in living here and working here in the future. So yep applied to a couple of different schools. Um. Choosing ending up choosing MIT. Um I would say that in terms of leadership style I would not consider myself a like a born leader. Um that said I do think that I am um my leadership style comes mostly from mediating things. Um I tend to be very you know I am really good at stepping back um and looking at a situation um as a big picture. I think using that while I dont necessarily you know take the center stage all the time and you know and stand up and you know order people around or anything like that. In that respect I feel like I can I can usually end up managing um different groups of people very well in a very um mediatory kind of manner. Absolutely yeah I definitely do consider myself a team player. And um an example I can tell you about is I actually work as an EMT um so an Emergency Medical Technician here on campus. And we have different um ranks within our crew so currently I am a second rider which means that theres theres usually somebody above me and as well as somebody below me in a single crew. And so one case was we were dispatched to a patient who had chest pains. And so we didnt know anything about this patient until we got there. Um. But when we did um mostly the crew chief the person above me and I were discussing you know what could potentially be the underlying problem. And you know we kind of disagreed on that initially um because my crew chief um talked about mentioned that you know it could be a cardio problem.Um. But I think whereas um I didnt necessarily think it was that. And so you know we took a couple of minutes just to stand back and kind of you know  consider all of the possibilities. And um we ended up having to ask the patient like a couple of other questions. Um. And what we ultimately found out was that he had a history of anxiety. So that um I think was was the was the root cause of the problem. And um I think that that was something that you know was something very important because um to to the care of the patient as we went down the line. Um. If I had the option to change one thing about myself. Um. I think that I would definitely choose to make myself more confident. Um. Mostly as a speaker I tend to be I tend to get um pretty nervous as yeah when I have to speak in front of large groups of people. Um and I have worked on that. Um. Both as an EMT you know you have to really work on your confidence so that you know your patients trust you a little bit more. Um and also as leaders of different groups on campus. Um such as Im leader of MIT Met Life as well as the Association of Taiwanese Students. So you know in the various uh clubs and groups that I am involved in across campus Ive definitely had to Ive definitely been using those opportunities to work on um you know giving myself opportunities to speak onstage in front of large groups of people.Yeah and I think that ultimately that would help a great deal as for me as a doctor in the future. Okay. There are a couple of reasons I think I should get into medical school. Number one I have a great deal of experience um in clinical fields as well as research. I work in a hematology lab here on campus. Um. Ive been working here for about a year already. Um and yeah I really really enjoy the process of you know going through the scientific investigation process as well as you know it gives you a lot of a lot of joy when you figure out.. Um. Whether or not something works. And um so I mentioned before also that I work as an EMT so I so beyond having the scientific background I also have a little bit of clinical background. Um. You know being able to manage patients and to talk to them. And I think thats thats you know a crucial component of being a doctor as well. But lastly I have a great deal of passion for the medical field. And um I hope that what I what I ultimately learn in medical school will give me I think the you know the opportunity to make a great difference in the medical field.,"[' Im good.', 'Okay so I was born in Irvine California um where I lived for about ten years.', 'And um my parents and I actually moved back to Taiwan um at that point.', 'So I went to an international school there.', 'Um.', 'It was mostly English speaking but outside of school I would often speak Mandarin also with a couple of friends um as well as you know just getting by in the outside world.', 'Yeah and so yeah so when I was after high school I decided to apply to colleges in the U.S. Um just because I was more interested in living here and working here in the future.', 'So yep applied to a couple of different schools.', 'Um.', 'Choosing ending up choosing MIT.', 'Um I would say that in terms of leadership style I would not consider myself a like a born leader.', 'Um that said I do think that I am um my leadership style comes mostly from mediating things.', 'Um I tend to be very you know I am really good at stepping back um and looking at a situation um as a big picture.', 'I think using that while I dont necessarily you know take the center stage all the time and you know and stand up and you know order people around or anything like that.', 'In that respect I feel like I can I can usually end up managing um different groups of people very well in a very um mediatory kind of manner.', 'Absolutely yeah I definitely do consider myself a team player.', 'And um an example I can tell you about is I actually work as an EMT um so an Emergency Medical Technician here on campus.', 'And we have different um ranks within our crew so currently I am a second rider which means that theres theres usually somebody above me and as well as somebody below me in a single crew.', 'And so one case was we were dispatched to a patient who had chest pains.', 'And so we didnt know anything about this patient until we got there.', 'Um.', 'But when we did um mostly the crew chief the person above me and I were discussing you know what could potentially be the underlying problem.', 'And you know we kind of disagreed on that initially um because my crew chief um talked about mentioned that you know it could be a cardio problem.Um.', 'But I think whereas um I didnt necessarily think it was that.', 'And so you know we took a couple of minutes just to stand back and kind of you know  consider all of the possibilities.', 'And um we ended up having to ask the patient like a couple of other questions.', 'Um.', 'And what we ultimately found out was that he had a history of anxiety.', 'So that um I think was was the was the root cause of the problem.', 'And um I think that that was something that you know was something very important because um to to the care of the patient as we went down the line.', 'Um.', 'If I had the option to change one thing about myself.', 'Um.', 'I think that I would definitely choose to make myself more confident.', 'Um.', 'Mostly as a speaker I tend to be I tend to get um pretty nervous as yeah when I have to speak in front of large groups of people.', 'Um and I have worked on that.', 'Um.', 'Both as an EMT you know you have to really work on your confidence so that you know your patients trust you a little bit more.', 'Um and also as leaders of different groups on campus.', 'Um such as Im leader of MIT Met Life as well as the Association of Taiwanese Students.', 'So you know in the various uh clubs and groups that I am involved in across campus Ive definitely had to Ive definitely been using those opportunities to work on um you know giving myself opportunities to speak onstage in front of large groups of people.Yeah and I think that ultimately that would help a great deal as for me as a doctor in the future.', 'Okay.', 'There are a couple of reasons I think I should get into medical school.', 'Number one I have a great deal of experience um in clinical fields as well as research.', 'I work in a hematology lab here on campus.', 'Um.', 'Ive been working here for about a year already.', 'Um and yeah I really really enjoy the process of you know going through the scientific investigation process as well as you know it gives you a lot of a lot of joy when you figure out..

114,114,pp63, Pretty good how was yours?<unintelligible>. Yeah its uh its been rather pleasant. I thought it was gonna snow today. Sure! Uh so I am an MIT Junior. Originally I was uh a freshman at Michigan and then I transferred to uh MIT for my sophomore year. Um thank you Im studying uh Computer Science and uh I guess I didnt really get into computer science until last year um or last summer er the summer before my sophomore year and then um ever since Ive more or less committed to it wholly and every minute to. Um I think in some respects I can be a leader but I wouldnt say like in everything I do Im a leader so um in certain activities that I take part in I definitely step up to a leadership position in certain situations but I dont tend to try to be a leader all the time-- --because I do like to listen to feedback and I like more of a group contribution as opposed to like a single person leading all tasks but like I remember doing a team exercise once where uh like lowering a Hula Hoop down with everyones hands um. when you have a group of people in a circle and we realized that you needed to have someone sort of spearhead the the operation there otherwise like everyones trying to do their own thing and so there are its mainly in those situations that Ill try to step up but most of the time I I dont like to be too controlling. Oh definitely! Um Sure um So uh I guess that was one example of a challenge uh that we handle as a team but um lets see...Ok so um last year I was pledging at my fraternity and we one of the activities we do as a pledge or as pledges is um organize the formal for in the Fall so uh were just given a budget and general guidelines for what a formal should consist of and then we were tasked with setting up everything. So um in this situation like all the 21 pledges uh we got together and we allocated tasks and um obviously when you have a large event like this with so many people where they get together to bring in to make it happen you need to sort of uh there are certain people who wont do their jobs and so um part of what we did was just have this sort of setup of accountability where you know more or less one pledge would check on another group of pledges to make sure that they were getting their task done and if they needed to help them out and so and this way we try to have somewhat decentralized leadership but still um manage to pull off yeah. Um lets see if I could change one thing? I would probably make myself slightly less of a procrastinator. I um I have a tendency to like when I have a lot of free time uh to to work on something I dont get started I dont make as much headway initially as I probably could or should. Um and tend um in that respect leave it its more like my work is more weighted towards the latter half of the deadline and so um I think just in terms of meeting my own goals like uh organizations that I get involved with projects it it would just be more productive to to be working uh full speed the entire time. Sure. Um ok so a job that Id like to have is uh software engineering role at uh a tech company or something. Uh and um I think I am a good fit for the job because I have a pretty strong background in computer programming skill sets for this position um Ive been taking various computer science classes at MIT and engineering classes and learning uh the proper was. Uh not THE proper ways but um good problem solving skills and ways to approach and ways to approach um hard problems and um thats I think those are skills that are not difficult not overly difficult to acquire but most many people do not acquire them in uh the engineering education.

115,115,pp64, Um So my name is Andre uh I come from Finland Ive studied for two years at Cambridge University in England umm where I did all sorts of engineering for the first two years but I chose to specialize in electrical engineering and information technologies. Um Currently Im on an exchange year abroad to MIT doing Course 6. And at MIT Im specializing in artificial intelligence -- machine learning (score vector?) machines -- and also device physics and some digital electronics. Um Specifically in the area of device physics and digital electronics Im looking at risk processors as well as um nanot- um micro- and nanoscale uh semiconductor devices such as transistors uhh specifically ballistic transistors which operate at the smallest possible unit. Em so yeah. Uhh In the area of AI I have undertaken uh certain competitions uh which I have been uh lucky to win. Um in the first one I had to write a simulator where um I wrote an AI to control a spacecraft which is -- -- supposed to be able to land and take off from Mars. And during that I had to take into account planetary rotation gravity atmospheric effects uh aerobraking and all those things so it was a pretty complex AI to be able to handle all of that. Um. Also I undertook a competition uh at Cambridge. Uhh in a team of six we had to build an autonomous robot which was able to navigate a grid and pick up an object and put it in a in the appropriate box. And there I um was a a team lead where I managed the team until it did the tasks. And also I wrote the AI for that. Um I think I have pretty good leadership qualities umm mainly because Im able to think uhh on a lo- longer scale like what has to get accomplished uhh and be able to delegate tasks to people to achieve intermediate goal which will be kind of modular to the achievement of the uhhh long term goal. So for example in the the um robotics project we had- our our ultimate goal was to build a chassis build an electronics build an AI and have the robot win this competition. But uhhh we- we didnt go from like scrap metal to that in one go. We had to uh we had to look at um specifically first I had to write an AI which was uh straight - the bit of a AI which was able to follow white lines on a black surface um and turn on the- uh at the junctions of those lines. Um The electronics guys to that end had to uh make some circuits which uhh connect the um infrared light form sensors to the kind of main CPU the arm-core CPU. Umm So there was some circuit elements involved. And the uh mechanics guys had to pretty much just make a test chassis for us um but all that took some organizing because they were busy in the workshops so they didnt have much time to screw arou -- to uh play around with um . . . you know other uh other things and the electronics guys had to um also schedule the time correctly. Um So one of the challenges in the robotics competition and this specific team was that um we often had to share resources which were limited among other teams and also among the people in the team.-hmm Um For -- One of the resources if I may say so which had to be shared in in our team was myself because I ha--(snickers) uhh I was a bit of the project lead so I had to give some advice and also umm sort out some technical points with both the electronics and the mechanics teams and also I had to write my own AI so I had to kind of balance between the uh two and kind of manage my time. So what I would try to do was I would tell them uh that we would work out some sort of specific issue of like sensor connections with the electrical uh team and I would say Okay guys so youre going to build this now and How long is this going to take? and they would say I dont know its going to take us uh a couple hours. And then I would have the time to maybe for half an hour go down to the workshop where the mechanical team are playing around and I would talk to them and see you know what theyre doing and how- how far apart they want the wheels or something uh for the you know for the touring to be efficient or where do you want the balance because uh we faced an an issue: if we put too much um weight on the back of the robot the robot might tip over. So we try uhhh we have to you know uh fix that issue. But uh once I had the two teams working uh I was able to go back and quickly um write some code. So the issue was that I needed to kind of give advice from time to time. Umm and I think I did that by delegating tasks pretty well. Um I think I would try to become more succinct in how I speak and more engaging to people because often I find that umm I come off sometimes a bit geeky or dorky and some people might not take to that a-- as easily. And ---hmm. -- as a team lead you have to be both inspiring and charismatic. Um I mean some uhhh some great examples I mean I guess as a cliche its kind of like Steve Jobs where hes uh amazingly inspiring hes very good at talking to people but hes also um like I wouldnt be able to say that hes kind of more (adducent?) to . . . While at the same time he is quite you know quite the geek being you know uh in charge of Apple and you know thinking about how to play with all these (unintelligible) . . . toys. So striking a balance like that where you kind of youre kind of able to have the fun with the tech and also be uh kind of serious  um but not boring-serious um so I try to strive towards that direction uh if I could. Um I think that being a project lead in a robotics design team or a like an electronic product design team uhh would be really great fun especially if I was also able to participate in the technical side and not only the managerial side. Umm because being on the managerial side would allow me to uh kind of be able to set the the direction uh in some way which I enjoy doing and also manage the kind of uh the sub-teams and how things will get done. But at the same time being on the technical side its just fun to play around with all this really cool tech and build it especially its quite rewarding. Um so I think I have the technical background for the technical part. Um Ive Ive done my programming Ive done my AI - AI courses my electronics courses so I so I know that pretty well. And I have the experience um of working in a team and being a team lead uhh to know how to manage a small but efficient team.

116,116,pp65, Um so Im obviously not from the States as the accent gives away. Im from a smallish town called Carifargus near Belfast in Northern Ireland. I just went to a local primary school there which is the equivalent of elementary school um for people this side of the pond. Uh and then like a local high school and uh was encouraged to within a year to consider applying to Cambridge which was something I hadnt really thought was something appropiate for me. I kind of just envisaged going to one of the Northern Irish universities maybe one of the Scottish ones. Um so I applied to Cambridge and luckily they seemed to think that I was suitable. So Ive spent the last two years um there studying engineering. And then the opportunity came up to spend my junior year here in the States. So I went for that immediately. Um Ive been moving into specialism of aerospace engineering -hm.Inerviewee: Uh just because Ive always been interested in space and um it would be quite uh like a personal ambition to be somehow involved in future space exploration um in terms of actually like desigining the stuff and helping to actually deliver it. Um so ideally thats where I see my kind of professional career path going. Uh aside from that stuff Im quite into sport. Like I have three younger brothers so wed often play sports together. Particularly rugby cricket um soccer. Uh but I have got into the American ones since being here. Um basketball um its probably the one that was least aware of before I got here but Ive managed to get tickets for a Celtics Timberwolves game tomorrow.[laughter] That should be good fun. And was as Fenway Park I think in my second week here or something. A Red Sox game so... Immersing myself in the American culture. Definitely enjoying my time here. Um yes I think that I have the self-confidence to be a leader. Im someone whos happy enough to stand in front of others and put their kind of head on the block as the saying is make a decision and accept that if it does go terrible the consequences will come back and I cant just pass the blame on. Uh I think this is self-evident in positions Ive held so far in my univeristy time in the UK where I was on the student council for my college Robinson College in Cambridge for both my freshmen and sophomore years. Um two different positions but both of them elected and competative elections. Obviously my peers think that Im uh suitable leadership material.-hm Um how does that allude to you from previous response sports is another big part of my life. And in that Ive had um competency rules with schools rugby and then college rugby and also college ruin. Um so I feel I have the experience of leader of having been a leader before and I have the confidence to lead others while also realizing at the same time that there will be others in the group that have strengths that I dont have. So um Im humble enough to realize that and and hopefully get the best out of others by not insisting that the way that Ive initially thought to approach the problem is the only solution. You can be a leader a very good leader by listening to suggestions that others have and being able to discern which are implementable and which are merely to put on the lets leave that for now pile. So yeah I would feel that Im a good leader. Yeah so the obvious examples here would be sporting achievements and stuff but I think and just out of a variety a good antitote for growth um in the UK we still have a monarchy one of the few countries that do.-hm. And the queens husband rather than being king is the Duke of Edinburgh. Im not sure why he doesnt get to be a king but anyway so theres a scheme called Duke of Edinburghs Award which is aimed at 16 17 18 year olds. And there are three tiers too bronze silver and gold. So Ive completed all of them. I have the set of the gold. And in order to do this a big part of it that people that undertake this scheme that they raise is the expedition element. Um you go somewhere you havent been before with coordinates certainly maps compass tents troungier and enough food and supplies for like four days. Um you follow a predetermined route but obviously you have to uh like deal with unexpected realities. If theres flooding and suddenly a path is no longer a viable transport option you got to reroute yourself around that. If I come too exposed and there are high winds you need to decide for a different sleeping point for that night. We did our gold expedition in the summers in the final years of my high school. We traveled to which is a very nice area naturally. We spent three days four night hiking really glorious weather. One big mission. When we encountered another group they were lost. quite hysterical. They thought they will never be found. We made a decision we would make a detour from our way to get these other hikers in the nearest area so that they can then contact the other hikers they knew in that area. and pretty much get themselves back in to familiar surroundings calm them down make sure they are okay and go on to our planned destination. To be honest I did quite enjoyed that experience. getting to feel slightly like a hero. That was a time when we had to work as a team. One of us could not have dealt with all by themselves because they were five hysterical people with all their backpacks and equipments. They were tired. They werent feeling like carrying any more we had to distribute their load among ourselves and make sure we do not lose them on our way from where we found them to where we ultimately drop them off in the nearest village. The whole expedition is a big example of team work. keeping each other motivated keep going at the pace of the slowest individual so that no one is left behind . encouraging each other so that the slowest individual is not on the ground . It was massively enjoyable experience. That would have been one major team work experience I think umm the one thing that really seems to set me aside between me and a lot of friends and my brothers that I could probably benefit from caring a little more about my outward appearance. Not that I think I dress very scruffly or anything but I dont really mind leaving the house in the morning with my hair soaking shower and wearing jeans and t-shirt. two out of three of my brothers worry about straighten hair which I wouldnt agree at all. but if I cared little more just making sure my hair is not messy when I leave the house that would probably be small benefit. given that even though there is a saying dont judge by covers people inevitably make decisions as soon as they see you. and they cant perhaps if I was a bit more self conscious about my appearance that would be something of a benefit I think this is the kind of job in which job satisfaction can be the greatest benefit if it is something that is genuinely interesting to you. And as I said before I have such a deep rooted interest in space exploration just really pushing the limits of what we can achieve. I feel that this kind of job is what I will just get up in the mornings really thrilled get into work and do my parts towards contributing towards it. umm I realize its also the kind of job where projects are really so vast ranging there is gonna be inevitable variety and also this would scare me I would be really drawn I get to challenge myself in various different ways novel situations that I perhaps havent encountered before with the opportunity to work with other professionals who are equally umm well established within the field that you are really getting to work with the best and that can only help improve me as a professional and as a business person. and its um yeah other things such as inevitable prestige and umm the financial benefit just the job satisfaction . I can easily see this something that will interest keep me coming back for work for the length of my career. That would be the key reason. um I think I would just be able to enjoy the work and therefore put my best and get the best out of my and ultimately give the company the best chance to success. thanks for letting me come out. umm It turned out okay. I think it was a group of case female. 17 to 18 years age range. we opened nearby village public and get to a public phone. our school was quite strict. didnt allow us to bring mobile phone. which was probably a good thing.,"[' Um so Im obviously not from the States as the accent gives away.', 'Im from a smallish town called Carifargus near Belfast in Northern Ireland.', 'I just went to a local primary school there which is the equivalent of elementary school um for people this side of the pond.', 'Uh and then like a local high school and uh was encouraged to within a year to consider applying to Cambridge which was something I hadnt really thought was something appropiate for me.', 'I kind of just envisaged going to one of the Northern Irish universities maybe one of the Scottish ones.', 'Um so I applied to Cambridge and luckily they seemed to think that I was suitable.', 'So Ive spent the last two years um there studying engineering.', 'And then the opportunity came up to spend my junior year here in the States.', 'So I went for that immediately.', 'Um Ive been moving into specialism of aerospace engineering -hm.Inerviewee: Uh just because Ive always been interested in space and um it would be quite uh like a personal ambition to be somehow involved in future space exploration um in terms of actually like desigining the stuff and helping to actually deliver it.', 'Um so ideally thats where I see my kind of professional career path going.', 'Uh aside from that stuff Im quite into sport.', 'Like I have three younger brothers so wed often play sports together.', 'Particularly rugby cricket um soccer.', 'Uh but I have got into the American ones since being here.', 'Um basketball um its probably the one that was least aware of before I got here but Ive managed to get tickets for a Celtics Timberwolves game tomorrow.', '[laughter] That should be good fun.', 'And was as Fenway Park I think in my second week here or something.', 'A Red Sox game so...

117,117,pp66, Im a student here at MIT Im in my third year as a junior um and Im studying chemical biological engineering with a minor in economics. And so as part of that Ive uh taken coursework in transport processes thermodynamics chemical biological processes and things like that. And also some macro micro public policy classes with the econ. And then Im also doing research in chemical engineering laboratory here for a year and a half studying yeast um and different ways of doing transcription factors and how they relate then to promoter architecture and the dynamics that are behind that. So lot of bio chemical engineering complications. And I also did some research this past summer in a systems biology lab in Madrid Spain um so a little more biology related so those are most of my technical background. Yeah so um I definitely think Im a leader and thats actually something thats come to define a lot of my time here at MIT is leadership. Um and so I think Im a leader both because of the actions Ive taken and also the mindset I have and as actions I guess both of those things are important. So to give an example um Im currently in a position of leadership in a club on campus our Habitat for Humanity club um where I serve as the president of the club and I think I started off as a freshman um just participating I really like community service so I volunteered with them a bit to go help build houses in the Boston/Cambridge area um and then I was fairly proactive which led me to start organizing those builds that I was going on I figured I was benefiting from them so I wanted to be able to give back and organize them so I ran for the exec of Habitat for Humanity here and started helping organize them and then from there I went on to wanting to do more and so now Im president and run the exec and get to do everything that the club does and so um I think that kind of drive and that desire to move up and give back and contribute and also make things happen definitely is characteristic of a leader. Um and obviously the position Im currently in is one that demands leadership. So I think thats just one illustrative example of why Im a leader. Yeah um so I definitely think Im a team player um and I think MIT especially is really conducive to teamwork. Um but Ill look at a example of team work than relates actually to um Im also involved in leadership within my fraternity. And so as a part of that um we have a five person exec that uh I wasnt on to begin with but uh Ive now loosened up and wanted to take on more leadership help out and so Im currently on. And so as a part of that five person exec um weve had to do a lot of teamwork. Theres five of us theres uh my fraternity has seventy people. Um so its very large and it requires a lot of working together in order to um accomplish really any task. And so I think um one illustrative example is we wanted to put on a philanthropy event that I was spearheading in my position. I was doing brotherhood development activities like a philanthropy even. And so we havent really had much precedent we havent had an event in a couple of years um and so I had come up with a summer with an event based off some stuff for other friends and other schools who Ive talked to. Um and so I had the idea for the event and then I had to work with these other four members to kind of lead the rest of our brotherhood in putting on the event organizing it um and there was a lot challenges because it wasnt there was no precedent we hadnt done things like this in the past um so we had to work to like motivate people within ourselves to go out and get people to register and participate and things like that. Um and theres also of course the challenge of then finding others. Um give us five dollars to participate in our event why its of any value why it matters. And so that duality was really a challenge as well as of course working amongst ourselves and so we met those by really laying out very concrete goals um and like doing a lot of brainstorming among the five of us breaking up um to focus on different elements of the problems we would face. Um and the event ended up being really tremendously successful and then we had a lot of people participate. We met those goals of participation and money raised um and then were able to have the event again this year and really set a precedent that hadnt existed before so it was very successful. Um so I think currently um what my greatest weakness and one which Im working on is my ability I talked a lot just now about leadership positions and so they definitely impact me a lot. Right now my ability to successfully delegate um and the word Im not necessarily looking for the word micro-manage but just truly delegate responsibility work with another person and let them be very responsible and communicate with them. I think i struggle there and thats definitely a weakness in my leadership as well as just my general activities because i struggle just to let that person kind of go and foster their own ideas and get their own job done. Im very quick to step in and assist maybe step on their toes even or at least provide feedback. Sometimes it is warranted and sometimes I think it isnt and so to be more cognizant of that and to uh be better adept to deal with that I think would be very helpful. And so Id love to see that change. It is something Im working towards and Im working with people whose leadership I admire um who I think do a better job of that then me and try and model myself after them but currently I do think its a weakness that Id like to improve. Okay. Yes. So for this particular job um I think my greatest assets are the combination of skills and experiences that I bring to the table. Um and I think that itd be very valuable for the position. So I have a very strong technical background Im in my third year at MIT studying chemical biological engineering which requires a wide array of very challenging coursework. Um and Ive done research in the field as well so all of those skills combine to give me a strong technical set of both problem solving and engineering based skills. And then I also have done a lot of work outside of the classroom both in projects that are academic related and totally not community services related and things of that nature um truly develop communication skills organization skills um and the ability to really take a project and get it done. And so I think for this position I will have the technical background to fully understand and wrap my mind around and make goals that I want to accomplish just solve a problem and then these other skills will ensure that not only can I identify a problem but if I identify a problem I will get it done and I know how to facilitate whatever resources that are available to me to ensure that whatever job gets done well so I think that will make me a very strong candidate.,"[' Im a student here at MIT Im in my third year as a junior um and Im studying chemical biological engineering with a

118,118,pp67, Alright. um So for starters I am a senior taking an extra semester so you know half-way through junior year in that sense. Im a chemical engineer Im a rower light weight rower not a heavy weight. I have the extra an extra bonus of having to deal with a weight cap that sort of thing. Diving in the middle of the year can be fun sometimes. Im in a fraternity um it actually recently started up. So I was a founding father of the fraternity its Sigma Alpha Epselon. And Ive also done very rougly coordinated engineering leadership program. So Id say those are my main commitments. I had done other things earlier one I went to Baker and I was very involved in the executive committee there. And Im also an active member in creating the dining plan that currently exists at MIT. Its got some pros and cons but it is a good experience so sort of like go door to door and talk to people and really see let them know whats coming up. THat sort of thing. In general Id say Im a pretty active person on campus pretty well known um and I do a lot of things to keep myself in shape but also academically stimulated with chemical engineering and whatnot. Very much so. um I guess to start out being part of the sport sort of creates a natural affinity towards teamwork. Especially with rowing youre depending on other people to be able to accomplish a common goal theres eight guys in a boat and then theres the person that steers it. And if one person gives up you guys arent going to win. So that is very much like teamwork it also coincides with leadership. Rowig doesnt necessarily cultivate leadership it sort of cultivates like personal dedication and willingness to contribute to the whole. But I feel like I get my leadership experiences from my fraternity. Especially since it started out I was one of eight people there was five that was the founding five that was part of the first pledge class. And when things are starting up everyone needs to take a leadership role and if anyone like cuts any slack its very likely that the whole ship is going to sink. So right from the get go I was given tons of responsibility and I went with it. I did as much as I could in each of the positions and eventually I came up to the role of you know the President. um And in that role Ive gotten a lot of praise from the alumni groups and from my students but generally I feel like Im a pretty good I like to work with people um I can relate to them and generally pretty sociable so yeah.(?) situation. So do you consider yourself a team player? Can you tell me of a time when you worked on a team and faced a challenge how did you go about solving it? Alright let me come up with a good example here. Alright Gordon has a new leadership program very much about being a team player. Theres different opportunities that that program provides every single week its divided up so that each student gets an opportunity to be a leader or be a part of the team. One of the modules for instance there was it was a negotiation module. So every single table was given a set of legos. And there was the goal of the project was to create satellites which requires a certain number of colored legos from each table and every table was given different combinations. So I was not the team leader in that case but the team leaders goal was to make sure that we had good negotiations going with all of the tables adjacent to us and coordinating everything. And at times it got a little bit frustrating because there were time limits and people were running all over the place. And one of my roles was to be one of the negotiators so as the team player my role was to simply talk to one table get as best of a result as possible to get the parts that we need to make the satellite but not to be directing people and nothing of the sort. um My natural instinct is to direct people so what I had to do instead to make sure that I was used effectively as a team leader you know just give the team leader suggestions that sort of things but also do my duty negotiate we consulted for a while. Said OK Cameron we need to get three white legos for four brown legos etc etc. So I managed to get my end of the deal done um also contribute to the team leader but also give him advice and that sort of thing. Its kind of a lower key example just because those modules the time schedule is an hour. But they put you in a high pressure situation but I felt like I did a good job there because I didnt go all up in arms and tell the team leader that he was not doing a good job that sort of thing. So I did my best to give him the suggestions to steer him in the right direction and ultimately it got us to the end goal. Yeah. I go back and forth with this. When I was younger in middle school uh I was a lot more modest I was just generally a quieter person. You know everyone goes through different phases through elementary middle high school college that sort of thing. um And ultimately I turned into someone taht was a lot more sociable outgoing that sort of thing. But at times I feel that I can come off as I hate saying this but I other people dont say it but sometimes I feel like I may say something and it might be cocky or something of the sort. So one thing Im really trying to balance is to make sure that I have confidence but its not overbearing. So I guess what Id wanna do right now like if I could change something is really try and bring back the modesty because I really respect people that are modest but still able to get a lot of work done. um And I mean its not something that I cant change its just something thats really not jibing with my personality right now. So Im really you know trying to tow the line. But if I could make that switch Id at least like to see what kind of a person Id like to be right now. I guess I guess Ill leave that answer for now. Yeah. Yeah. Well the job is its a pretty lots of people look are sort of looking at it at MIT but its consulting. You work with people you work with teams and every single team has a project with a defined deadline scope budget that sort of thing. Which is the stuff Ive learned from the Gordon Leadership Engineering Program. Um so that you know exactly that working in a team trying to accomplish a goal in a certain time blah blah blah. Im a very big fan of that ever since I joined the program Im like wow this is business I like business. And the reason why I prefer consulting right now rather than going into energy or going into connectors? that sort of thing is just because of the breadth. I like Im a person that likes to keep my doors open and consulting is one of those really good segways in my opinion from undergraduate into the industry. Im not particularly interested in grad school at the moment just because theres no one thing that like I wanna like I dont wanna narrow my scope quite yet. So I feel like consulting will give me an environment where theres still a young vibe with a lot of newer people and also expose me to older people and really uh Ill be able to test my skills that Ive cultivated while Ive been here in the job industry.

119,119,pp69, Uhh so Im uhh I was born in D.C. moved to Nigeria when I was seven umm came back to America for my junior and senior year of highschool and applied to MIT. I always wanted to be a mechanical engineer so it was sort of a straightforward choice for me. It was always my first choice school and umm I was excited to come here and to start learning things. It just in the past it had just been sort of hearing about things but not doing anything or learning about it which was exciting. So Im studying mechanical engineering here now and umm Im concentrating in computer science and electro engineering which has been a new found interest I guess. Its uhh Im a junior now so yeah. I do think Im a leader in some regards. I mean its important to not always and sometimes you dont want to be a leader. Um its important to know how to follow as well but I think umm I am like in most situations a leader. For example I was uh sort of like the leader for my 212 Intro to Robotics group where we build a robot amongst the four of us four to five. Uhh my group happened to be four. We built a robot. I sort of lead the group: organizing meetings uhh delegating tasks making sure that everyone was doing uhh what they were meant to and just getting everyone on the same page. So just instances like that I think have shaped me into being a leader. Uhh so yeah like I said its also important to know how to you know let someone else take the lead.-hmm. And so my other project class this semester Im taking to double in (unintelligible) and its a group of eight people so theres even more sort of heads to balance. And so uhh just sort of working with everyone making sure that you know everyone sort of has a say in whats going on. Theres a particular instance where its at the beginning of the project were meant to design a yo-yo and we couldnt really decide on a design cause everyone wanted to do their own sort of thing. And umm my role in that particular situation was to getting everyone to recognize the manufacturing aspect and not only the design aspect. So we ended up choosing something that was easy to manufacture as well as had a good design. Change one thing about myself... Uhh Id say like to...I wish I had a sort of better background of academics. Uhh I didnt go to like the best high school. I didnt uhh like have the best teachers or things like that. And coming to a place like this and sort of seeing a lot of people who are I mean obviously kind of naturally talented but who have also had good- theyve had opportunities to uhh show their talent and get better and smarter. Umm I wish I couldve had that opportunity. I think Id be uhh even more- I could do more things than I am doing today. So yeah. Mmm-hmm. Because uhh you should hire me for a few reasons. One is because my leadership uhh abilities which Ive talked a little bit about umm a little earlier. But also just my willingness to learn. Umm I think more than the average person Im excited to learn new things umm and sort of put those things in practice. And just as an example I didnt know anything about computer science before coming to MIT. But just uhh taking just the introductory class learning about that I got really interested in that and so Id say that when I dont know a lot of things or when my experience isnt the best Im always willing to learn a lot. And lastly Im a really hard worker. And so Im able to put in the hours and the time and the energy that it takes to sort of get a task done. Its uhh yeah I think Id make a good intern.

120,120,pp7, Ok. Im a junior at MIT majoring in electrical engineering computer science as well as mathematics. Um and I have a couple of previous internships under my belt as you can see on my resume so I feel like I come prepared with a lot of experience both from school and outside. Uh yes I would say that I am a leader. Um in particular Ive been involved in many student groups on campus such as educational studies program mystery hunt and several other groups that I have leaderships positions in. But even when I dont have a formal leadership role as I do in those groups I feel like I still tend to take charge in situations whether its a group project for the class where you know were supposed to be working collaboratively but Ill be sending emails to make sure were moving forward and making progress. Or something a bit more structured actually supposed to have a have a leader like I mentioned student groups. Yeah. So yes heh I would call myself a team player and to go back to sort of one of the examples I was just talking about with uh the educational studies program with a fairly large student group. We have a couple hundred different MIT students teach with us but a core team of about 30 to 40 admins who come to meetings every week and help out. And unfortunately being college students theres a lot of personal conflict between members and I have had to step in several times with sort of individual people first notice that theres a problem um talk to the people in question individually to figure out more about whats going on and then intervene and sort of set aside rules and sort of help them interact well professionally and keep their problems outside the group. Um I dont really want to get into details because some of these can be personal but I have had to do this. Its a difficult question. Id probably say my age. I feel like there are a lot of experiences Ive missed out on sort of looking backing at you know high school say now that Im in college or looking back at a first internship once Ive done a second. Um there are a lot of ways I think I couldve learned more or matured more as a person had I got into situations with a different mindset.

Um so together we delegated work and so one person had to do this um reach out to them and one person had to do that and i was def a big part of taking in whatever everything that we had to do and like trying to make sure everyone had something in order to not let this really important part of our work would be lost. Uh i would def say it would be my self confidence issues. or rather my ability to speak up and be more uhm  assertive about my point of view. Ive definitely a lot of times kept quiet or just like put my views on the back burner especially I think when i was a fresh coming to a new country it was very difficult to integrate and also like to navigate my way in so i think im still trying to cope with that. I def think i deserve to get into grad school because its the only thing i want to do - research for me is extremely exciting and there is a lot. i feel like its the most meaningful way that i can contribute to  uh the scientific world. and especially in my field.

122,122,pp71, Im good how are you? So Im studying mechanical engineering at MIT and I am taking the flexible course which lets me concentrate on a subject other than mechanical engineering... ...and Ive chosen to concentrate on building technology. And on top of that um Im double minoring in energy and architecture to supplement my concentration. And Id say two years ago two summers ago sorry I interned at Square One Armoring Services which is a company that manufactures armored vehicles for the government. And I interned with them for two summers and this was before I really chose the building technology route. I didnt really like the super mechy side of it. This past summer I interned in Barcelona um with a company called Ilon(?) theyre a very large engineering consulting firm and I worked in their architecture department. And I really enjoyed the experience. So Im going that direction. I believe I am a leader. Um I normally I wouldnt necessarily run for positions but when it comes down to someone filling the spot I will step up um and make sure that things get done. I feel that I might be more of a...of an encourager so to speak...I dont really like sliding my ideas down the table and making everyone follow it but I try sort of to like to lead people in the direction that I want to go to and to integrate their input with mine. Um so I uh had a coach here this past year to plan the campus preview weekend dinner um at my sorority. Its a weekend where MIT pre-freshmen come on campus to see if they like the feeling from MIT and its a big recruiting event for a lot of different groups around campus. And um so my coach and I had very different ideas at times about what we wanted to do and how to go about doing it but I feel that communication was defiantly the most important factor in sort of getting through those difficulties and working together as a team and we wound up having a really successful event. Um a lot of the girls that came to the dinner um who are now freshmen still say Oh I remember you from (unintelligible). It was a really good feeling to get through that. Um Id probably change trying to be a perfectionist. Um I like doing things right and sometimes its not the most time efficient or energy efficient way of getting about things. Um I think thats something to sort of a strange thing to work on to let things be sometimes heh. I think Im qualified for this position academically and Ive taken a lot of courses that apply to building technology. And my intern experience as well. Im really interested in the subject matter and my parents are architects so Ive sort of had this my whole life and Ive always kind of denied my interest in architecture because everyone always pushed me towards it but now I do realize that this is something I truly enjoy. And sort of mixing it in with my other more technical interests um I feel bring me further in the field.,"[' Im good how are you?', 'So Im studying mechanical engineering at MIT and I am taking the flexible course which lets me concentrate on a subject other than mechanical engineering... ...and Ive chosen to concentrate on building technology.', 'And on top of that um Im double minoring in energy and architecture to supplement my concentration.', 'And Id say two years ago two summers ago sorry I interned at Square One Armoring Services which is a company that manufactures armored vehicles for the government.', 'And I interned with them for two summers and this was before I really chose the building technology route.', 'I didnt really like the super mechy side of it.', 'This past summer I interned in Barcelona um with a company called Ilon(?)', 'theyre a very large engineering consulting firm and I worked in their architecture department.', 'And I really enjoyed the experience.', 'So Im going that direction.', 'I believe I am a leader.', 'Um I normally I wouldnt necessarily run for positions but when it comes down to someone filling the spot I will step up um and make sure that things get done.', 'I feel that I might be more of a...of an encourager so to speak...I dont really like sliding my ideas down the table and making everyone follow it but I try sort of to like to lead people in the direction that I want to go to and to integrate their input with mine.', 'Um so I uh had a coach here this past year to plan the campus preview weekend dinner um at my sorority.', 'Its a weekend where MIT pre-freshmen come on campus to see if they like the feeling from MIT and its a big recruiting event for a lot of different groups around campus.', 'And um so my coach and I had very different ideas at times about what we wanted to do and how to go about doing it but I feel that communication was defiantly the most important factor in sort of getting through those difficulties and working together as a team and we wound up having a really successful event.', 'Um a lot of the girls that came to the dinner um who are now freshmen still say Oh I remember you from (unintelligible).', 'It was a really good feeling to get through that.', 'Um Id probably change trying to be a perfectionist.', 'Um I like doing things right and sometimes its not the most time efficient or energy efficient way of getting about things.', 'Um I think thats something to sort of a strange thing to work on to let things be sometimes heh.', 'I think Im qualified for this position academically and Ive taken a lot of courses that apply to building technology.', 'And my intern experience as well.', 'Im really interested in the subject matter and my parents are architects so Ive sort of had this my whole life and Ive always kind of denied my interest in architecture because everyone always pushed me towards it but now I do realize that this is something I truly enjoy.', 'And sort of mixing it in with my other more technical interests um I feel bring me further in the field.']","[array([0.23260541, 0.00101473, 0.00569431, 0.00083825, 0.75984734],

123,123,pp72, Good how are you? Um. OK so Im a third year linguistics student umm Im uhh working on some linguistics research right now and Im interested in going into linguistics research after undergrad. Um. Yea I think Im uhh leader. I think Ive fulfilled leadership positions in the past and umm I think Ive excelled in that role umm. Ive led different group projects in my classes and Ive also been umm a resident associate advisor in my dorm umm and Ive led activities there where we had to organize events for freshmen once a month uhh to get them interested in different aspects of the curriculum and also umm just general helping them out for things so. OK umm so yea I think I work well as a team member umm for a big group project we had in one of my linguistics classes umm we had to look at aspects of a language and so we were broken into groups of four umm and we were each split to look into different aspect of the language so two people looked at the phonology or the sounds of the system and my partner and I looked at the grammar of the language and so one of the two people assigned to the phonology group wasnt really following through with his part of the work umm. He I guess he was busy with other classes but his partner was really stressed out about it so she came and talked to my partner and I and asked what she should do about it cause he wasnt helping out. And so the three of us sort of talked about it and then we emailed him asked if he could come meet with all of us. The four of us were able to talk about it and work out an agreement where he did some of the...some extra work in putting the two parts together the phonology and the syntax to make up for the fact that he hadnt done as much for the original research. So that ended up working out well so. Um I think it would...probably be my shyness because that tends to hold me back. Um but I think Ive been working to change that. Um Ive been trying to practice things umm like presentations that make me nervous or that I have problems with because Im shy. Ive also been trying to get out and meet more people. Ive been doing more extracurriculars. And umm I volunteered to teach a class to middle schoolers and high schoolers so that sort of helped in a low stress environment practising presenting.

124,124,pp73, Im good how are you? Im a freshman at MIT here so Im studying courses 6 and 18 which is computer science and math. Umm in high school I did a lot of community work service. I was the president of our United Way board which is a not for profit. I did a lot of our school clubs math teams classic goal. I was captain of a lot of those and then on campus here part of my sorority Sigma Kappa the tech. fair which is involved in bringing a lot of companies and students here to showcase their things. I think so. I think umm I have a little different view of what a leader is. I think theres definitely one aspect thats very obvious that you know you bring everyone to do what you think is best but I think the most important part of being a leader is incorporate everyone elses ideas. I think a lot of times some people who are really strong are like natural leaders but they dont always take the time to make sure everyone else likes what theyre doing and theyre very straight forward and they go for it but I think what makes a really important leader is being able to incorporate everyone elses ideas and find that middle ground that everyone wants to do. Definitely umm I know in high school as a senior last year they gave us a lot of group projects to kind of bring us out of the stereotypical classroom and get ready for uh a new environment in college and I remember one of our projects it was my group and we were doing something for our econ. class and it was we had to like model a situation and do the graphs and econs like very straight forward graph wise there isnt that much to deal with but my group had like different ideas of how they thought the lines would shift and I remember everyone was just kind of in a panic. We had to double graph four different scenarios and no one knew what they wanted to do and we just had to take them two at a time and I like looked at all of the graphs and there was some things that were similar just everyone had a different way of going about it so I like kind of tried to combine all the ideas and we ended up coming up with a graph that was almost a combination of everyones so it worked out in the end. I think what Id change about myself is that I Ive always grown up a very private person. At home it was just I always felt like my problems and my issues werent as important as what other people were dealing with so I tend to deal with them myself which as you grow older and the problems are just so silly like a little middle school problem may become a lot more weighty when you have so many of them and so because of that its sometimes I get bogged down in myself. And I never let it affect my work because I dont want anyone else to be burdened by it but after a while it gets very overwhelming and so I wish that Id just be more willing to share that with people. I think I should get this job because I think theres so many opportunities at this company that Id really like to be a part of. Theres just a lot of chance for growth and a lot of chance also to do something that you love and also make a difference because of it. I think that the way I deal with problems and working together but also trying to find the best solution and bring people to that level is something that could really benefit the company as well.,"[' Im good how are you?', 'Im a freshman at MIT here so Im studying courses 6 and 18 which is computer science and math.', 'Umm in high school I did a lot of community work service.', 'I was the president of our United Way board which is a not for profit.', 'I did a lot of our school clubs math teams classic goal.', 'I was captain of a lot of those and then on campus here part of my sorority Sigma Kappa the tech.', 'fair which is involved in bringing a lot of companies and students here to showcase their things.', 'I think so.', 'I think umm I have a little different view of what a leader is.', 'I think theres definitely one aspect thats very obvious that you know you bring everyone to do what you think is best but I think the most important part of being a leader is incorporate everyone elses ideas.', 'I think a lot of times some people who are really strong are like natural leaders but they dont always take the time to make sure everyone else likes what theyre doing and theyre very straight forward and they go for it but I think what makes a really important leader is being able to incorporate everyone elses ideas and find that middle ground that everyone wants to do.', 'Definitely umm I know in high school as a senior last year they gave us a lot of group projects to kind of bring us out of the stereotypical classroom and get ready for uh a new environment in college and I remember one of our projects it was my group and we were doing something for our econ.', 'class and it was we had to like model a situation and do the graphs and econs like very straight forward graph wise there isnt that much to deal with but my group had like different ideas of how they thought the lines would shift and I remember everyone was just kind of in a panic.', 'We had to double graph four different scenarios and no one knew what they wanted to do and we just had to take them two at a time and I like looked at all of the graphs and there was some things that were similar just everyone had a different way of going about it so I like kind of tried to combine all the ideas and we ended up coming up with a graph that was almost a combination of everyones so it worked out in the end.', 'I think what Id change about myself is that I Ive always grown up a very private person.', 'At home it was just I always felt like my problems and my issues werent as important as what other people were dealing with so I tend to deal with them myself which as you grow older and the problems are just so silly like a little middle school problem may become a lot more weighty when you have so many of them and so because of that its sometimes I get bogged down in myself.', 'And I never let it affect my work because I dont want anyone else to be burdened by it but after a while it gets very overwhelming and so I wish that Id just be more willing to share that with people.', 'I think I should get this job because I think theres so many opportunities at this company that Id really like to be a part of.', 'Theres just a lot of chance for growth and a lot of chance also to do something that you love and also make a difference because of it.', 'I think that the way I deal with problems and working together but also trying to find the best solution and bring people to that level is something that could really benefit the company as well.']","[array([0.23260541, 0.00101473, 0.00569431, 0.00083825, 0.75984734],

Umm and Im primarily directing this project and I work with some grad students and I make the plans for how its going to work. Okay. Umm recently I was working umm just this last week actually in a group for my computational biology class. And we had some struggles dividing the work. It was it was kind of a difficult thing to especially since some of us were from a biological background and some of us were from a computational background. Umm we had a hard time deciding the project so that it was equal work for everyone. So it was kind of difficult to resolve that but what we ended up doing was changing our project. Umm so I tried to come up with some ways to make sure that everybody had enough umm enough work to do based on their backgrounds. Umm I think that I would like to make myself more comfortable umm meeting new people. I think that that would enrich my life. I think that I have great background and great experience specifically in the field that that this job would be for. And I really enjoy learning new things and I think that Im be good at it.

126,126,pp76, Im doing well thanks. And yourself? Well Im Zaynab. I am a junior in chemical-- majored in chemical engineering at MIT but Im doing a minor in energy studies and a fo-- a concentration in anthropology. I think that I am a leader. This is because Ive held various leadership positions at college thus far and I think with my leadership the groups and the organizations that Ive been part of have been able to succeed. For instance at the moment Im the vice president of the African Students Association and the MIT African Students Association as well a group of 80 students both international and domestic students.-hmm. So were more of a social group where we throw social events such as like cultural shows and study breaks and things like that just to get the African students ignited and just united so that they can confront each with whatever problems they have.-hmm. So I guess the most recent event that we had was a cultural show where we displayed to the entire MIT community just about what its like to be African like through-- we did it through performances such as like dancing singing spoken word and things like that. And also other schools from the Boston/Cambridge area like Harvard Boston University Wellesley and so on they also came attendance and that was fun. I think the time like when there was a conflict in my team was when I was doing this project for one of my classes which was in my sophomore year. So there was like a group of four of us and we all divided the topic evenly so that we could all focus on a specific part of the project. -hmm. However there was one person that just wasnt pulling her weight. So I wasnt too sure whether it was just shes stressed or busy with other things like towards the end of the semester where she just didnt put the effort into doing what she was meant to do. So I did confront her about it and she told me that she hadnt had time to do the necessary work. So I just said just block out some time in your schedule and lets meet up and lets do the work together and we were able to produce um I guess a very good product at the end of the day.

I think I would be more outgoing in the terms of speaking being able to speak to others more freely and confidently because at the moment I do speak with people I dont know and do work with people that arent my friends or arent in my social circle but I wish I was more outgoing in the sense of I was more comfortable speaking with other people and interacting with other people things like that.

127,127,pp77, Im doing well how are you? So my background is in mechanical engineering um whats um... and product management so product development. Uh basically what Im looking to do now is uh find a role that combines product management and uh communications skills to be with a technical background as well. Yes um so I think leadership doesnt have to be something that always uh  done in a formal role. I think leadership is something that you do actively in every part of your life uh whether its taking initiative turning on a light in a dark classroom when no body wants to stand up something small like that to actually having a formal leadership role with uh leading a group and team members. So I try to always uh stay on top of those things. So take initiative if Im in a group scheduling a meeting whether I have a formal role um and be on top of things and uh be proactive. Definitely. Uh so right now Im working on a I just actually finished a group project that we were doing. And we had to design this uh speech system. And we got to a point within our system where we surveyed a large number of people it was like 630 people that we surveyed and we realized that what they wanted was not what wed designed our system for. And so they wanted a system in which they could basically just review comments and posts. Its all from this uh inspired by [?]ISawYou which is this website that MIT students uh post missed connections on. And you can post and you can comment and people can just read. Well what we found out was that almost 90% of the people just read the website. And we were planning on this system where you could post and comment. Well were like wait a minute; this isnt going to work if everybody is just reading the web site. And so half of our group was wanted to stay with our original plan. Were like okay guys we dont have much time to implement lets just stick here and go for it. Then the other half was like no we have a huge problem we need to fix it. So uh what we did was we just sat down together in a room. Talked about all the options. And really tried to put our at least I definitely tried to put all my um original bias out of the way. Uh because I knew that we had a huge conflict going on one of us was going to have to abandon there was probably a good idea out there somewhere. Um so I just put that behind me and really listened to what all my other team members were saying. Um and it turned out they had a great idea and we just presented today and the system worked out really well.We changed the direction to fit what our users wanted and uh came to a solution that we were all really happy with. One thing about myself. Thats a tough one. I have a tendency sometimes to take on a lot all at once and not.. I will sometimes get bogged down in all the little details of prioritizing all the small fun things that I have to do and not always taking a step back and focusing on um the small picture. But Im trying to change that in the way I focus on manage my time um really noticing what is it that Im dedicating my time to and how can it be better utilized. Or what is it that is actually should be a priority. Um and how do I reorganize things. So I try to do that um at least weekly just look back you know what did I do this week what did I get done where was I loosing time what was happening. Um to try to make try to uh fix that tendency in myself and um hope that becomes habit. I think I have a lot of qualifications that um fit exactly what this job is asking for. Uh both the skills to communicate and to manage people and technical background so I understand whats going on. Uh but beyond that I really I love the company. I love whats happening at the company Im inspired by the work here. And for me its really important that I not only enjoy the work Im doing but also the people Im doing it with. And so far everyone that Ive met Ive loved them.

129,129,pp79, Um Good. Related to self or career or… Ok um so my name Jessica Aria and I come from uh India. I come from IT thinking and I do computers. I then did chemical engineering in Europe and Indonesia which I found amazing. So I was like maybe this is what I want to do. So I shifted over to computer science um and Im a junior right now. Its been going great. Im generally interested in um in energy education recently robotics um. And uh  What I um I hope to do Im not particulary clear about what I want to do after that. Hopefully eventually something enterprenurial. And definitely including something I experience with before that. Depending on how that goes I may not stick with academics after that. Um Ive always been super excited about that and doing projects that actually make a difference to you know people. Thats kind of what I want to do. But how I want to do it um is not yet been foregone.  re a leader? Tell me why. Um I do um. Well there is all that said sorts definitions of leadership. I do believe um that I have had the good fortune of being a leader um in numerous student clubs and in high school and even at MIT. Um even in the presence of graduate students. Um Ive managed to sort of um. Obivously they know more academically but um Ive still managed to like hold my ground. Oh and because I think Im involved in a lot of stuff that goes on on campus stuff thats just and um thats what sort of made me realize that um I do like people. I like working with people and I like generally working on a team. I do believe Im good enough to sort of lead and at the same time technical enough to sort of understand what it is that we want to achieve. And convince everyone and have this mutual consensus that this is how we should do it. Um so yeah definitely I feel like I like working with teams I like people. I work with um and example related to a class I took. I dont remember the name of it exactly but it was something related to mobile development. We had to make an app as part of the class and one of our ideas was that if you have the I-phones and you could kind of bump the two of them together. It was kind of a novel idea in relation to what everyone else was doing in terms of photo sharing and meeeting friends. I was required with the technical expertise. There was this new thing that was developed at MITs regional lab called SWIPE which I had basically allowed you to swipe from one phone to another for data sharing. It was to get data across. It wasnt really what we wanted but we thought it was a good start. A couple of members on my team knew the people that started it and one girl on my team was particular gung ho about it um the four the us. One guy was experienced and super excited to be trying new stuff. Another experienced programmer was relatively alright with this and then there was me who was sort of relatively alright. Um and there was someone else who was a freshman at the time and she was basically ok with every idea that we said. Intervieweee: So um and he really wanted to use it. But after a few tries he realized it wasnt working. And we went back to the people who made sky- uh SWIPE and they said maybe its not read for production yet and maybe you should stop using. While the other member of my team still wanted to keep using it. Um we had to sit back but we had to still complete the project so um we had to deal with somehow understanding where he comes from and we had to sort of do something about it. We had a meeting that resolved it um and we had to sort of say “this is why we think SWIPE is cool but this is also why we think we should not use it.” We had to complain that um that link is like swipe but it would not do what we needed it to. Over a series of meetings he came to realize that um it evolved that you know um we had to stick to the group. And we would say something like “maybe you could do this link real quick for me ” and he had to realize like “maybe I can.” (laughter). So he was like it was a very short time to get him to sort of fix it. So we would not use SWIPE but thought of something that thought pushes and you know. I so well I would actually change even though this is in the past. I would have a deeper understanding understanding of math. That sounds really strange I know. But what I consider myself intuitive in general I understand the concept. I would want to know what to do in that situation. But in other situations I realize this is a really into academics. I realize that having a superior understanding of mathematics is so key. Um I really believe I have a good understanding. I just really wish I had done more of that um you know when I was littler. I wish I had just like known what I wanted to do when I was really little so I could have actually started working on it. But that being said thats not something thats not something thats something Im already working towards shifting. Ive already gotten a lot better at you know understanding you know the theory behind the math. Um and definitely by the time you know I graduate um ready for this to will have changed. You know some people have been doing it since they were you know five and I kind of been doing it. This is not what I understand right now but last year I sort of could. Im in my last semester as in three classes away from completing my computer science degree. So that makes me feel like I can do that. I wish I had done it a lot earlier. Um well its because first its about first its because Im super excited about working in this industry and definitely in this company working with great people. Um I think there is a lot to be learned from that. And those two factors really is basically uh why I want it. And as to why I should get it and its because I can learn really quickly and um. I believe that Im a team player and um and try to really fix things. And I would like to quote one of my professors who said either youre building the product or selling it or getting in the way. So I definitely feel that um I could be um building the product really well um and to contribute in general.

130,130,pp8, So I am a Junior at M.I.T Ah I am in computer science and I have taken several classes in Algorithms and in [xx]Nessus six  and I am also doing studying on my own machine and I plan on taking that next semester before summer starts umm to develop data analysis and machine running skills . Especially in field of pattern recognition which I am very interest in. And uh I hope that will give me some training for internship that I will do in that field. ah That will give me more practice in the real world I think I am. I think I am a leader. Ah I have lead several projects in the past ah As in my position as that community service chair and um and one in my ah fraternity pledge class and the other in my ah in the student group that I am part of. The South Asian American Student Corp and successfully completed. um Service projects with the community as well as organizing ah events for ah raising money for charity  ah and also for school projects. I frequently ah I am good at assigning tasks keeping people on task and um as well as gathering input from everybody um which I think are the essential quality of a good leader  I do consider myself a team player. Ah Going back to the example of my pledge class from my fraternity. uh we had several tasks. One of which would be to visit every other every student in the pledge class. Storm week this was during freshman year.  and with a pledge class has 13 people it is not a impossible task but there were logistical problem. One communication trying to get everybody to participate another is figuring out the best way to go about things. People wanting to meet in the middle ect. So I did my part as a team member to lead people to my room and show up myself. um But a good team player should also make sure that other people are doing their job. ah Not necessarily in a lead or a managerial role. But with the same general properties as a leader ah that all the team members should be checking one another and so I ah pardon that to um when there was several members missing I would ah say hey you call this person and I will call this person. Split up tasks etc. Ah and also help in planning with whats the best route to go by etc. If I had to change one thing about myself? Naturally there are a lot of thing I wish i could change about myself. I wish I could do better at basketball.(Snicker} But ah I think if I had to pick one quality it would probably be my ah abillity to stay focused on a task Although I am pretty efficient at ah getting things done and I do create ideas sometimes I get distracted or I like to multitask so I might be staying on task with work in general but Ill like to have three different homework sessions going on at once and find this one and this. A lot of times that will work really well for me but if I working collaboratively that may not work best for other people. So making myself more adaptive to other peoples study styles working styles etc that would probably help me a lot  I think I should get this job because ah for two main reasons. One because I would provide a lot the company because I am very efficient at working. I can think creatively for new ideas. Say for new ways to analyse certain new data or to optimize the running of the ah of certain ah software. ah On the other hand. The other reason I should get this job. Is because I would be a valuable member of valuable member of the workplace in this field I think by getting more experience um with this start up I think I would ah Really would help me with my study skills that would help me in the future ,"[' So I am a Junior at M.I.T Ah I am in computer science and I have taken several classes in Algorithms and in [xx]Nessus six  and I am also doing studying on my own machine and I plan on taking that next semester before summer starts umm to develop data analysis and machine running skills .', 'Especially in field of pattern recognition which I am very interest in.', 'And uh I hope that will give me some training for internship that I will do in that field.', 'ah That will give me more practice in the real world I think I am.', 'I think I am a leader.', 'Ah I have lead several projects in the past ah As in my position as that community service chair and um and one in my ah fraternity pledge class and the other in my ah in the student group that I am part of.', 'The South Asian American Student Corp and successfully completed.', 'um Service projects with the community as well as organizing ah events for ah raising money for charity  ah and also for school projects.', 'I frequently ah I am good at assigning tasks keeping people on task and um as well as gathering input from everybody um which I think are the essential quality of a good leader  I do consider myself a team player.', 'Ah Going back to the example of my pledge class from my fraternity.', 'uh we had several tasks.', 'One of which would be to visit every other every student in the pledge class.', 'Storm week this was during freshman year.', 'and with a pledge class has 13 people it is not a impossible task but there were logistical problem.', 'One communication trying to get everybody to participate another is figuring out the best way to go about things.', 'People wanting to meet in the middle ect.', 'So I did my part as a team member to lead people to my room and show up myself.', 'um But a good team player should also make sure that other people are doing their job.', 'ah Not necessarily in a lead or a managerial role.', 'But with the same general properties as a leader ah that all the team members should be checking one another and so I ah pardon that to um when there was several members missing I would ah say hey you call this person and I will call this person.', 'Split up tasks etc.', 'Ah and also help in planning with whats the best route to go by etc.', 'If I had to change one thing about myself?', 'Naturally there are a lot of thing I wish i could change about myself.', 'I wish I could do better at basketball.', '(Snicker} But ah I think if I had to pick one quality it would probably be my ah abillity to stay focused on a task Although I am pretty efficient at ah getting things done and I do create ideas sometimes I get distracted or I like to multitask so I might be staying on task with work in general but Ill like to have three different homework sessions going on at once and find this one and this.', 'A lot of times that will work really well for me but if I working collaboratively that may not work best for other people.', 'So making myself more adaptive to other peoples study styles working styles etc that would probably help me a lot  I think I should get this job because ah for two main reasons.', 'One because I would provide a lot the company because I am very efficient at working.', 'I can think creatively for new ideas.', 'Say for new ways to analyse certain new data or to optimize the running of the ah of certain ah software.', 'ah On the other hand.', 'The other reason I should get this job.', 'Is because I would be a valuable member of valuable member of the workplace in this field I think by getting more experience um with this start up I think I would ah Really would help me with my study skills that would help me in the future']","[array([0.11185779, 0.02451197, 0.22435766, 0.00218148, 0.6370911 ],

131,131,pp80,[inaudible] Mm-hmm. Fine thank you. How about yourself? So Im from Berkley California.-hmm. And I came to MIT to study bioengineering. And its been a really great education because Ive learned to combine like engineering skills real world skills with all this academic knowledge um and especially true in my lab where the combination between hands-on research and like thinking about how the research is working has really come together to improve my understanding of science and medicine. I think I have great leadership potential. Uh I am currently head of the Greek MedLinks at MIT. And what MedLinks is is this really great program where we serve as the liaison between students and healthcare facilities. MIT has so much support so much support. And there is...I mean we have...the students have great access to it. But a lot of times we dont know to look for it. Right? It can be right in front of your face and if youre not looking its not there. So we do a lot of outreach stuff. And I as head of the Greek MedLinks uh I really try and encourage people in their fraternities and sororities to uh  get involve with their the people that they assess and teach them a lot about nutrition and health. And then I organize inter-Greek MedLinks events. So this has really improved my leadership because it helped me learn to do organizational skills and really learn to listen to feedback because you cant lead people that dont want to be led. So. Sure. So I think team work is...the only way to get anything done...right an individual what are you going to do? Um so I played on the golf team in high school. And were a close-knit team. But golf is a mental game and sometimes it can get to your head if youre not playing well and you just play worse. And its a downward spiral. And youre with someone out on the course for five hours. And if you have like a little feud between each other youre still going to be stuck with that person for five hours. And one time my teammate was playing not as well. And it was a pressured situation. And we have you have a break in between 2 1/2 half hours. And the rest of the team was doing pretty well but she wasnt. And they were sort of pressuring her to do better. And I sort of said Well guys like its going to make her do worse you know so let up. And we joked around and that really helped resolve the conflict. So I think its important to like understand that the angle is more important than your own personal goal like winning this trophy. Its more important to be like be cohesive and function as a unit. So Im not great with administrative work. I have trouble with like little menial deadlines and all this writing and signatures and getting everything organized. It stresses me out. But Im learning to deal with it by electronics...ah! The new age! It is my savior.I had...with the new iMac and iPhone and the way they interconnect means that if I have to do something theres going to be like six alarms that are going to go and remind me. And so with my computer and my phone so if I cant hear one I can probably probably would [inaudible] the other. So thats really helped. It helped relieve the stress. Knowing that Im going to be reminded is almost enough to take my mind off of it so I can focus on what Im doing. Well I think I should go to medical school because I love people and I love to help and Ive got the academic background for it. Im not afraid to work hard and put in long hours. Medicine is fascinating surrounded by all these diseases that...I mean weve made such great progress but theres just more that we can study. So Im currently studying in my lab uh work in an HIV lab.

132,132,pp81, Um I am a sophomore at MIT. Um Im studying brain and cognitive science with a minor in biology. Right now Im working in a lab that is more of a narrow cognition lab. We work um basically to try to figure out pathways in the brain that process different functions. Um its a longitudinal study. Um so its something Im really interested in. But I think moving forward Im going to try to start working with from a pharmacology aspect because its such an emerging field. Um thats mainly where I want to go because I hope to eventually work um in [??] and so pharmacology would be very important for that field.re a leader? Tell me why. I think I am a leader in a sense that I see people as people and I see tasks as tasks and I know how to communicate effectively between how to get these tasks done and how to get the people to do them. And I think Im a good motivator good communicator and Im also very detail-oriented. So it helps me better able to break down um people in order to delegate um more fundamentals or specific tasks in order to get them done more effectively. Yes I consider myself a team player because I do think Im very fair and always open to what other people are thinking. So in [??] movement which is an on-campus student group which basically seeks to provide inner city Boston high school students with better access to reading and math comprehension to help better prepare them for the SAT test. We meet with three or four of them once a week on a Sunday. And large groups so theyre like small groups that two members are on a charter. So Im part of a two-person team and then we all meet together. So I would sometimes disagree with my partner as well as the [??] as a whole in terms of what we should be teaching and what we should be focusing on whether we should look more at science whether we should have more holistic education versus just teaching to the SAT. I think that basically what I was trying to do was explain my point. If the group thought that what I was saying had some merit and liked to incorporate it I would feel good. But if they didnt then I would accept the fact that that was the way they felt; and you know majority rules and I didnt have any hard feelings. At the end of the day I wanted whats best for the kids. So in a sense I am a team player because I want whats best for the project as a whole. Its not just all about me and getting my point across. I definitely think it would be making myself more organized. So Im extremely detail-oriented and I see exactly what needs to be done and the timeline it needs to get done. But I guess since Im involved in so many things being a student as well as in a sorority as well as pursuing various academic endeavors I think that um sometimes that bogs me down. Knowing exactly what I need to get done and what timeline and then I get overstretched. But I think thats an easy problem to fix. Um and so far as we you know you get more specialized over the course of our lives. I definitely have a path that is more specialized that I intend to pursue. So that wont be a problem and I think just maintaining basic organizational structure definitely helps me but it would be a lot easier if I didnt have to maintain anything and that was just naturally the way I was so... I think that I have… Im very interested in what your company is doing and Im very interested in what this project specifically is related to but I also think I have a lot to offer the group as well. I am a MIT student whos given a very specific set of problems and some solving skills that would be very unique to the group. But Im also very outgoing and very interested in interpersonal relationships and I think that could help me convey our message as well as work with the technical aspect of the team.,"[' Um I am a sophomore at MIT.', 'Um Im studying brain and cognitive science with a minor in biology.', 'Right now Im working in a lab that is more of a narrow cognition lab.', 'We work um basically to try to figure out pathways in the brain that process different functions.', 'Um its a longitudinal study.', 'Um so its something Im really interested in.', 'But I think moving forward Im going to try to start working with from a pharmacology aspect because its such an emerging field.', 'Um thats mainly where I want to go because I hope to eventually work um in [??]', 'and so pharmacology would be very important for that field.re a leader?', 'Tell me why.', 'I think I am a leader in a sense that I see people as people and I see tasks as tasks and I know how to communicate effectively between how to get these tasks done and how to get the people to do them.', 'And I think Im a good motivator good communicator and Im also very detail-oriented.', 'So it helps me better able to break down um people in order to delegate um more fundamentals or specific tasks in order to get them done more effectively.', 'Yes I consider myself a team player because I do think Im very fair and always open to what other people are thinking.', 'So in [??]', 'movement which is an on-campus student group which basically seeks to provide inner city Boston high school students with better access to reading and math comprehension to help better prepare them for the SAT test.', 'We meet with three or four of them once a week on a Sunday.', 'And large groups so theyre like small groups that two members are on a charter.', 'So Im part of a two-person team and then we all meet together.', 'So I would sometimes disagree with my partner as well as the [??]', 'as a whole in terms of what we should be teaching and what we should be focusing on whether we should look more at science whether we should have more holistic education versus just teaching to the SAT.', 'I think that basically what I was trying to do was explain my point.', 'If the group thought that what I was saying had some merit and liked to incorporate it I would feel good.', 'But if they didnt then I would accept the fact that that was the way they felt; and you know majority rules and I didnt have any hard feelings.', 'At the end of the day I wanted whats best for the kids.', 'So in a sense I am a team player because I want whats best for the project as a whole.', 'Its not just all about me and getting my point across.', 'I definitely think it would be making myself more organized.', 'So Im extremely detail-oriented and I see exactly what needs to be done and the timeline it needs to get done.', 'But I guess since Im involved in so many things being a student as well as in a sorority as well as pursuing various academic endeavors I think that um sometimes that bogs me down.', 'Knowing exactly what I need to get done and what timeline and then I get overstretched.', 'But I think thats an easy problem to fix.', 'Um and so far as we you know you get more specialized over the course of our lives.', 'I definitely have a path that is more specialized that I intend to pursue.', 'So that wont be a problem and I think just maintaining basic organizational structure definitely helps me but it would be a lot easier if I didnt have to maintain anything and that was just naturally the way I was so...', 'I think that I have… Im very interested in what your company is doing and Im very interested in what this project specifically is related to but I also think I have a lot to offer the group as well.', 'I am a MIT student whos given a very specific set of problems and some solving skills that would be very unique to the group.', 'But Im also very outgoing and very interested in interpersonal relationships and I think that could help me convey our message as well as work with the technical aspect of the team.']","[array([0.2706857 , 0.02691895, 0.04319452, 0.00104036, 0.65816045],

133,133,pp83, Um pretty good pretty good. Getting busy with studying for finals. Um alright so I Ive been studying at MIT for three years. I initially started as a physics major actually so sophomore year I took um a couple physics classes in relativity um waves and vibrations. Uh and then one of the classes that had been recommended to me was computational neuroscience which also counts for physics department. So um after that was intro to neuroscience. So I took that fell in love with neuroscience and cognitive neuroscience so... I started taking more classes in that. Um Im working on it um definitely. Uh I mean I do I do like working in a team as equal group members um I feel like I can be a leader. Uh for example this past summer I was in China and uh they let me uh teach a classroom of 60 students. Um and so that really help to strengthen my leadership skills just in terms of classroom management and getting everyone to work together as a group. Yeah. Um I feel like I I um so uh in that last summer as well in China we had sort of a problem. Uh we were trying to get some videos up on a website...-hmm. ...um none of us had any computer science background and so um I tried to find a student who had both computer science background and spoke English to a level where we could like actually communicate... Um so uh I participated in that in that kind of way. Hmm... lets see. Um Id say probably I get kind of nervous sometimes. Um Id say Id like to calm down a little bit.-hmm. Uh I mean sometimes its good like I... I have lots of energy but sometimes its just a bit too much. [laughs]-huh. To be able to [??].-huh. OK. And why do you think you should get the job? Um so I mean Im very committed but on top of that I have a very strong academic background. Ive done research before in this area...-hmm. And um in a similar field but sort of um also different. So I think I come in with a different sort of perspective to this. And also I mean I come in with like some physics background. So I think that additionally provides a different perspective on brain and cognitive science that isnt always seen.-hmm. That sort of like very analytical way of thinking and like seeing things at the most fundamental level I bring that perspective in.,"[' Um pretty good pretty good.', 'Getting busy with studying for finals.', 'Um alright so I Ive been studying at MIT for three years.', 'I initially started as a physics major actually so sophomore year I took um a couple physics classes in relativity um waves and vibrations.', 'Uh and then one of the classes that had been recommended to me was computational neuroscience which also counts for physics department.', 'So um after that was intro to neuroscience.', 'So I took that fell in love with neuroscience and cognitive neuroscience so...', 'I started taking more classes in that.', 'Um Im working on it um definitely.', 'Uh I mean I do I do like working in a team as equal group members um I feel like I can be a leader.', 'Uh for example this past summer I was in China and uh they let me uh teach a classroom of 60 students.', 'Um and so that really help to strengthen my leadership skills just in terms of classroom management and getting everyone to work together as a group.', 'Yeah.', 'Um I feel like I I um so uh in that last summer as well in China we had sort of a problem.', 'Uh we were trying to get some videos up on a website...-hmm.', '...um none of us had any computer science background and so um I tried to find a student who had both computer science background and spoke English to a level where we could like actually communicate...

134,134,pp84, Good thank you how are you? Alright well so Im originally from Australia. And um since then my family and I have moved around a lot so I would consider myself an international citizen. Im actually not an American citizen. Um but Ive been here studying at MIT material science for uh three years now and Im enjoying it. Um its helped me figure out that Im really interested in engineering and Im really loving having a bit of material science as well as mechanical engineering which is what Im doing a minor it. Yes definitely. Um well I can tell you that I was told that at a leadership conference that I went to earlier this year. Um we classified personalities in team-working situations and I was definitely one of the more leader type one people where I work well with a team but I like have things I like to do things well my way or I like to at least be...if I want to see something done right then want to I would like to do it right. Um then Ive had a lot of chance to practice that and I would say that Ive gotten pretty good at incorporating that personality type with other types of personalities in teamwork situations. So for example Im um co-president Ive recently been elected president of Amnesty International here on campus and I so Ive had a lot of experience with that group up until now working with them trying to lead a team trying to help them take initiative for themselves trying to encourage them as well as be a leader by example and do all of as much as I can uh handle comfortably to make the club a success. Okay um well. Yeah um Amnesty International is another good example. Weve had a few tensions between personalities. Um the year before so last year we had two co-presidents and one of them was a pretty opinionated person someone who had strong feelings toward his vision for the club and just went for it with all like all of his effort into that one direction and just didnt really look back and didnt look around to see how other people felt about it. Which I was okay with because I saw his direction being really beneficial for the club um but we had another member of the team who was not okay with that. She felt also that she had a lot to give and she felt like none of her ideas were being heard. So they would actually get into some tense email situations and there was a bit of tension in the group. But it actually kind of became resolved during elections this year. Um they worked together fairly well during the semester um especially when they werent both in the same room at the same time just working via email it was good. And then today uh sorry this week during elections it kind of all came out into the open and now that hes not president any more and shes in the same role as treasurer um its been resolved. Um I guess my role in that was just kind of being uh the team player. Just trying to make whatever we trying to do work successfully so that there was no added tension from our efforts being a failure.  Oh interesting question. I I would like to be a better public speaker actually. I would really like to be able to synthesize my thoughts quickly and coherently. Um I think that would make me a better writer and I think that in general being a great at communicating is one of the strongest skills that you can have to convince people to to just make whatever project youre working on be a success. To convince investors to invest money to obtain partnerships and sponsorships to be a good leader to inspire...I think I would love to be able to just have an infinite vocabulary and have a very you know better way of presenting my ideas. Um I do think I am qualified for the job because Ive had a lot of experience in this industry. Ive worked in research in material science for the last two summers as well as Ive had a lot of leadership experience um not just in Amnesty International but also in my sorority. And um what was the other one I was an orientation leader for um orientation at MIT which was a cool experience. So um Ive had a lot different ways to develop my team-working skills and Id really like to put those to work in industry-based projects now um which Ive seen a lot of but Ive never had a chance to actually try it out. So Im excited to try that.,"[' Good thank you how are you?', 'Alright well so Im originally from Australia.', 'And um since then my family and I have moved around a lot so I would consider myself an international citizen.', 'Im actually not an American citizen.', 'Um but Ive been here studying at MIT material science for uh three years now and Im enjoying it.', 'Um its helped me figure out that Im really interested in engineering and Im really loving having a bit of material science as well as mechanical engineering which is what Im doing a minor it.', 'Yes definitely.', 'Um well I can tell you that I was told that at a leadership conference that I went to earlier this year.', 'Um we classified personalities in team-working situations and I was definitely one of the more leader type one people where I work well with a team but I like have things I like to do things well my way or I like to at least be...if I want to see something done right then want to I would like to do it right.', 'Um then Ive had a lot of chance to practice that and I would say that Ive gotten pretty good at incorporating that personality type with other types of personalities in teamwork situations.', 'So for example Im um co-president Ive recently been elected president of Amnesty International here on campus and I so Ive had a lot of experience with that group up until now working with them trying to lead a team trying to help them take initiative for themselves trying to encourage them as well as be a leader by example and do all of as much as I can uh handle comfortably to make the club a success.', 'Okay um well.', 'Yeah um Amnesty International is another good example.', 'Weve had a few tensions between personalities.', 'Um the year before so last year we had two co-presidents and one of them was a pretty opinionated person someone who had strong feelings toward his vision for the club and just went for it with all like all of his effort into that one direction and just didnt really look back and didnt look around to see how other people felt about it.', 'Which I was okay with because I saw his direction being really beneficial for the club um but we had another member of the team who was not okay with that.', 'She felt also that she had a lot to give and she felt like none of her ideas were being heard.', 'So they would actually get into some tense email situations and there was a bit of tension in the group.', 'But it actually kind of became resolved during elections this year.', 'Um they worked together fairly well during the semester um especially when they werent both in the same room at the same time just working via email it was good.', 'And then today uh sorry this week during elections it kind of all came out into the open and now that hes not president any more and shes in the same role as treasurer um its been resolved.', 'Um I guess my role in that was just kind of being uh the team player.', 'Just trying to make whatever we trying to do work successfully so that there was no added tension from our efforts being a failure.', 'Oh interesting question.', 'I I would like to be a better public speaker actually.', 'I would really like to be able to synthesize my thoughts quickly and coherently.', 'Um I think that would make me a better writer and I think that in general being a great at communicating is one of the strongest skills that you can have to convince people to to just make whatever project youre working on be a success.', 'To convince investors to invest money to obtain partnerships and sponsorships to be a good leader to inspire...I think I would love to be able to just have an infinite vocabulary and have a very you know better way of presenting my ideas.', 'Um I do think I am qualified for the job because Ive had a lot of experience in this industry.', 'Ive worked in research in material science for the last two summers as well as Ive had a lot of leadership experience um not just in Amnesty International but also in my sorority.', 'And um what was the other one I was an orientation leader for um orientation at MIT which was a cool experience.', 'So um Ive had a lot different ways to develop my team-working skills and Id really like to put those to work in industry-based projects now um which Ive seen a lot of but Ive never had a chance to actually try it out.', 'So Im excited to try that.']","[array([9.0038228e-01, 6.6801475e-04, 1.5706142e-03, 1.4036170e-03,

135,135,pp85, Okay well Im a junior here at MIT. Umm Im double-majoring courses ?? which is uh the ?? computer science and bioengineering and I guess those are two very different things so I get alot of questions about why and I think its um because I came to MIT thinking I wanted to do bioengineering. And then I guess I just feel like I everyone around here like has some relation to programming sometime and then I took a programming class got bit by the bug and then I just like I loved it. And then so last year I decided to double major cause um Im actually interested in a lot of I guess there is an overlap between like biocircuits as well as just modeling biological systems with computer science so um it was a really good opportunity here so yeah. Um I do think Im a leader and then I guess thats one of the things me coming to MIT I wouldnt have said Im a leader necessarily even though like I guess I was like did some things in high school. But um I think thats one of the things I really thankful from MIT its really developed my ability to be confident as well as um I think just to motivate other people and uh and its like just like if I wanted to get something done like I think something really... like I think something really cool will happen with some ideea then what Ill do is Ill like get a couple of people together like get them motivated by uh figuring out what needs to get done logistically and just like assign people I think a timeline and stuff like that? And I think um my experience at MIT has uh like really given me that experience and as well as actually just allowing me to find these people that cause theres a lot of really awesome people here and usually willing to do the exact same thing.. or you tell them about other ideas and theyre really excited about it just like you are. So. So yeah so I think um what like one of the things I guess obviously is you have to be able to take direction just as well as you give it otherwise youre team cant function. And so I guess um one of the times I was on a team was um for example ah in a fraternity and for the fall we have rush which is basically all...we have 26 fraternities at MIT theres a 1 000 incoming freshman. Youre essentially like all somehow competing almost for them but ah I guess one of the other things youre just looking for the people that are a good fit for you but you want to meet as many people as possible. So I think one of the things that is you have to be able to take direction from your from our rush chair. So its sometimes he needs you just to go out on campus and try to get random freshman to the house. Sometimes you just need to go talk to people at the house and then like just have a converstaion with them and learn more about them. Sometimes you just need to clean dishes from the food event cause we need to get the next event so I think um just being able to...willing to take direction just doing anything and not losing track of the bigger goal is I think what makes me a good team player.INterviewee: Ah Alpha Delta Phi? Its right in Central Square. Lot of nice restaurants. laugh Ah thats uh a really interesting question. Um. I think I would make myself ah maybe a little bit better I think just in um social sitatuions with strangers. Um sometimes I just can get a little bit like anxious. Uh. For example I hate like bit networking events because like I never really know how to like walk up to someone like just maybe like have small talk and then just leave the conversation. Thats some of the things that like I guess Ive never really been too extroverted of a person so I dont really like say necessarily good at just meeting lots of new people getting them like making a memorable impression or something like that? So I think um thats one of the the things Ive been trying to work on. I think thats whats really nice about MIT is theres a lot of people like that.  Theres a lot a research.. theres a lot of like lot of ahh session for people like theres a bunch of opportunities for networking for people who hate networking and then I think a lot of people have the same or similar just like philosphy about it. Um so I think just need to change to be better about that and just be better at talking to strangers and less apprehensive about approaching people and just starting up a conversation.-hmm. Theres definitely a thing one can work on theres definitly a...? Ok so think what job youd like to have. So why do you think you should get this job? Ok so I guess um right now Im looking for some software internships for the summer and I think why I should have that job is just because I think Ive gotten the technical background from like algorithms classes like software engineering classes? But then Ive also had um the experiences of working as a team at MIT like uh Im on student government um with my fraternity as well as uh I guess Im pretty independent. I think MIT really develops everybody you choose your own classes like your own activities? And I think Im very self-sufficient so I thnk uh for like maybe like super.. Ive like mabye supervised peers in previous internships and I think I would just be able to like take a project. Im not afraid to ask a question if I need direction and I mostly like I can just work alone so I think its be very helpful for I guess just like a supervisor cause then they dont have to check up on me all the time and uh but then uh the would also know that I would go to them when needed. Uh also Im very thourough so I would like I dont like leaving things like if theres a small mistake Ill like even if it takes a long time Ill make sure that I can iron it out so I think for code-wise thats really nice for testing in that its often more bug-free.

136,136,pp86, In my technical background um. Been a junior at MIT. Um I studied a lot of music but Ive been mainly studying robotics mechanical engineering and a little bit of electrical uh at MIT here. So uh Ive done a few robot competitions built a few and um you know thats basically what I do build robots and play music. I think I am a leader. Um because um Im very calm. And I dont over react and Im very good at I wouldnt handling is the wrong word. But I guess you know dealing with people and making sure that they can relate with other people. Making a team work. That type of stuff. Um I like to think Im pretty sociable. Um Im a nice guy and Im easy to talk to and I think those are all very nice traits for a leader.-Hm So I would say yes Im a good leader and based on previous leadership experience I say that I did a pretty good job so. Um I Id definitely say Im a good team player. Now are you asking about how I worked well with the team or how well I worked bringing the team together or how well I worked okay well uh Ill address all of them. Um I guess as a team member I very quickly learned what my role was and asked you know if theres anything I can do what do I need to do? And I do that fill that role. Um but Im also very good at you know kind of combining all of the roles together. So say lets just you know on a robot for example theres mechanical theres electrical theres theres code work that also needs to be put together. And everyone can do a great job by themselves. But if theyre not working together then you know like if I dont know what the guy the code guy is working on and what energy equations he needs and that type of stuff then I as an electronic guy or as a mechanical guy like its not gonna work. Um and thats how I guess I work well within a team is kind of bringing people together. Um but if there are any like challenges I guess I faced as a team um I guess that really wasnt the question though was it. Could you repeat the question again Im sorry. Okay um okay so a recent project I worked on with friends. Um there were these two guys. Love them to death theyre great guys very talented Tyler and Dan. Theyre very close. Theyve been very close for I guess freshmen year. Um they have one of those relationships where good you know good high points but theres also like they fight a lot. So um there were a couple moments where they were just pissed at each other. They hated each other. They couldnt work well together so what I did was I kind of you know told them take take a step back. Tyler were gonna go to the student center. Were gonna grab some food chillax and then were gonna get back. And while we were walking to the student center I talked to him about it and talked to what his issues were. And then on the way back he was much more calm and things progressed a lot smoother and much faster. I would say.-hm well well this helps. So if you were to change one thing about yourself what would it be? One thing okay. Um I would say time management.-hm Definitely time management. Um its been rough my whole life. Um Id say its definitely been getting better but Ive definitely had problems with Im very much living in the now and so sometimes I forget to think ahead. and um there have been many instances where Ive got into trouble. I have a lot of work to do and its you know coming up in like a few days. And sometimes I I should work harder earlier on but I dont get you know I dont get Im like well I could work on it but Ive done enough tonight. Why dont I I can figure it out tomorrow. And usually end up working really hard um right at the end. Which I guess a lot of people end up doing but if that was one thing I could change Id say definitely better time management being able to spread it out more evenly and be more prepared. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Um should I go with just go with let my imagination flow? All right. Okay so were at a robotics interview. Um well I think I deserve this job a lot because Ive been working very hard. I know a ton of control background. I know a ton about robotics mechanical engineering. Um Ive had a ton of um hands-on work with robots. Um and I know all the work that goes into it. Um so as far as background and experience that Ive had with robotics Id say Im very well um informed I wouldnt say informed. I experienced I dont want to use the word experienced again but thats I have a lot of experience in robotics. Um and Ive since Ive been working with it for such a long time I can learn more about it quicker and Im very Im very fast to learn. So throw me in a new situation. Ill you know Oh okay I know what that is. I can relate to that and I just work from there. Um and I think Im a very I work well with people so robotics is one of those things where you have to work with a bunch of a group of people for a common goal. And Id like to think that Im very good at working with people so -hmm Um and it it sounds like a fun place to work. I Ive talked to you know some friends and some other people working there. And its just Id really love to work there. And I think Im a good fit.,"[' In my technical background um.', 'Been a junior at MIT.', 'Um I studied a lot of music but Ive been mainly studying robotics mechanical engineering and a little bit of

them to death theyre great guys very talented Tyler and Dan.', 'Theyre very close.', 'Theyve been very close for I guess freshmen year.', 'Um they have one of those relationships where good you know good high points but theres also like they fight a lot.', 'So um there were a couple moments where they were just pissed at each other.', 'They hated each other.', 'They couldnt work well together so what I did was I kind of you know told them take take a step back.', 'Tyler were gonna go to the student center.', 'Were gonna grab some food chillax and then were gonna get back.', 'And while we were walking to the student center I talked to him about it and talked to what his issues were.', 'And then on the way back he was much more calm and things progressed a lot smoother and much faster.', 'I would say.-hm well well this helps.', 'So if you were to change one thing about yourself what would it be?', 'One thing okay.', 'Um I would say time management.-hm Definitely time management.', 'Um

I guess a lot of people end up doing but if that was one thing I could change Id say definitely better time management being able to spread it out more evenly and be more prepared.', 'Okay.', 'Yeah.',

137,137,pp89, Mhmm uh so is it all right if I kind of talk about the same stuff as last time? I was going to say I havent changed too much but um yeah so still a junior at MIT here and um about halfway through junior year and um Im a physics major and um Im from Pensacola Florida and um Im yeah so born and raised in Pensacola and I just um uh you know moved up here a couple years ago and started at MIT and I uh Im not sure as far as what Im going to go into career wise but Im looking at something applied in the physics area. And um as far as extracurricular go I do a few things. Im involved with a few IM sports that my fraternity does uh soccer and basketball and I enjoy juggling and unicycling as well. Ive done Ive unicylced since 5th grade and Ive done that a lot and um Im involved with the juggling club here and I like to play ultimate Frisbee as well from time to time just for fun and um yeah so you know enjoy doing sports in my spare time but uh yeah physics as far as school goes.re a leader and tell me why. Do I think Im sorry? A leader. Oh um yeah in some senses I like as far as leadership experience Ive had Ive enjoyed more in the small group type things. Like Ive mentioned before in high school I led a small group of students to do a community service project where we organized a math competition. And um I uh I enjoy doing um for one of my internships I worked at a robotics firm and it was a pretty small group it was 4 or 5 of us but I go to kind of have some leadership on some of the tasks there that was fun. And uh yeah I mean juggling club is a little bit of a leadership position theres a few people I kind of oversee there. And you know those few leadership experiences Ive had have been really good um you know I guess besides those three I havent had any larger scale leadership experiences with you know more people but those I have enjoyed. I guess I consider myself a leader in that regard.re a team player? Can you tell me about a time when you worked on a team and you faced a challenge. How did you solve it? Yeah um so I mean this past semester Ive done some team stuff just one on one with a partner for my um lab class. And um so I got to kind of do some team playing there. But um I guess another time was uh last January I was in Mexico as well but this time it was with an exchange program and it was the whole month and next week Ill actually going back for fun for a week. But yeah it was  Mexico and it was me and two other students at a high school and we basically got there and we thought they were going to know what were supposed to do it was the first time they had done the program and we get there and they were like “Okay well what are you guys going to do.” And we were like “Well we were going to ask you the same thing.” So we kind of had to come together with the three of us and figure out what to do. So we uh we talked at first and well kind of had familiarity with a lot of different subjects as far as like especially applications of what these students were learning calculus and physics and how to demonstrate those. We decided to each give little lectures on topics that were relevant to what the students were learning they might you know be going to a certain field to apply later on like especially calculus but also the physics classes and stuff. I ended up doing two main things I gave a few physics demonstrations uh and you know they had some equipment there I just talked about vectors and how to halve those and force equations. And then you know we had a couple weights and walked through the class how to predict how it would work out and actually measured it and so that was cool. All three of the students collaborated on what we should talk about because we kind of were familiar with what everybody else was talking about. It turned out pretty well we ended up helping them out and getting their students to have some faith and how these things of learning are applied. Yeah so I guess major time where a big obstacle is overcome. Um lets see well the first thing that popped in my mind was that uh if I was a little shorter I could be an astronaut. But I think the height requirement is changed for that. Im 63” and I think a few years ago it was 61” which is the cut off.t change your height though so what could you change? Okay yeah that too. Um I guess um lets see my um uh I guess as far as larger scale positions go like kind of being decisive. I think this is like a common problem for you know undergraduates here. Because you know you come in and I guess a major way American schools are different from schools in other countries. We have all the options open and so um you know its a tough thing to you know have all these options and be decisive with one thing. And be able to like you know if youre in an environment where youre more restricted and you just put yourself in that. As far as larger scales go and smaller scales too with whether its I dont know just managing things just day to day. I feel like time managements you know a major part of that being decisive stuff. Yeah I think decision making would be the main thing.d like to have. So one in mind? Yep. Um well Im standing by one of the things I mentioned before. Which is mainly that I think I communicate pretty well. As far as small groups Ive had a good amount of experience Working with people on you know in real time problem solving. Ive had experience there and I think thats a major attribute that I can bring to the board and bring to the table and um as far as experience goes yeah I mean things I mentioned before just coming back as far as like Diversity of background and being able to bring multiple perspectives. I have kind of experience with physics and more like applied things like robotics. So I think that diversity of things really helps and um yeah.

decided to each give little lectures on topics that were relevant to what the students were learning they might you know be going to a certain field to apply later on like especially calculus but also the physics classes and stuff.', 'I ended up doing two main things I gave a few physics demonstrations uh and you know they had some equipment there I just talked about vectors and how to halve those and force equations.', 'And then you know we had a couple weights and walked through the class how to predict how it would work out and actually measured it and so that was cool.', 'All three of the students collaborated on what we should talk about because we kind of were familiar with what everybody else was talking about.', 'It turned out pretty well we ended up helping them out and getting their students to have some faith and how these things of learning are applied.', 'Yeah so I guess major time where a big obstacle is overcome.', 'Um lets see well the first thing that popped in my mind was that uh if I was a little shorter I could be an astronaut.', 'But I think the height requirement is changed for that.', 'Im 63” and I think a few years ago it was 61” which is the cut off.t change your height though so what could you change?', 'Okay yeah that too.', 'Um I guess um lets see my um uh I guess as far as larger scale positions go like kind of being decisive.', 'I think this is like a common problem for you know undergraduates here.', 'Because you know you come in and I guess a major way American schools are different from schools in other countries.', 'We have all the options open and so um you know its a tough thing to you know have all these options and be decisive with one thing.', 'And be able to like you know if youre in an environment where youre more restricted and you just put yourself in that.', 'As far as larger scales go and smaller scales too with whether its I dont know just managing things just day to day.', 'I feel like time managements you know a major part of that being decisive stuff.', 'Yeah I think decision making would be the main thing.d like to have.', 'So one in mind?', 'Yep.', 'Um well Im standing by one of the things I mentioned before.', 'Which is mainly that I think I communicate pretty well.', 'As far as small groups Ive had a good amount of experience Working with people on you know in real time problem solving.', 'Ive had experience there and I think thats a major attribute that I can bring to the board and bring to the table and um as far as experience goes yeah I mean things I mentioned before just coming back as far as like Diversity of background and being able to bring multiple perspectives.', 'I have kind of experience with physics and more like applied things like robotics.', 'So I think that diversity of things really helps and um yeah.', 'Yeah thank you.']","[array([0.10859198, 0.18439862, 0.09972628, 0.05986281, 0.5474203 ],
